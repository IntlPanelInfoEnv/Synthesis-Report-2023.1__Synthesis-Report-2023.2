500,COORDINATING A MULTIPLATFORM DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN INTERNET RESEARCH AGENCY ACTIVITY ON THREE US SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS 2015 TO 2017,"THOUGH NATION-STATES HAVE LONG UTILIZED DISINFORMATION TO INFLUENCE FOREIGN AUDIENCES, RUSSIAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S 2015 TO 2017 CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE U.S.Ã¢â‚¬â€EXECUTED BY THE INTERNET RESEARCH AGENCY (IRA) Ã¢â‚¬â€IS UNIQUE IN ITS COMPLEXITY AND DISTRIBUTION THROUGH THE DIGITAL COMMUNICATION ECOLOGY. THE FOLLOWING STUDY EXPLORES IRA ACTIVITY ON THREE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS, FACEBOOK, TWITTER, AND REDDIT, TO UNDERSTAND HOW ACTIVITIES ON THESE SITES WERE TEMPORALLY COORDINATED. USING A VAR ANALYSIS WITH GRANGER CAUSALITY TESTS, RESULTS SHOW THAT IRA REDDIT ACTIVITY GRANGER CAUSED IRA TWITTER ACTIVITY WITHIN A ONE-WEEK LAG. ONE EXPLANATION MAY BE THAT THE INTERNET RESEARCH AGENCY IS TRIAL BALLOONING ON ONE PLATFORM (I.E., REDDIT) TO FIGURE OUT WHICH MESSAGES ARE OPTIMAL TO DISTRIBUTE ON OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA (I.E., TWITTER).

542,CREDIBILITY PERCEPTIONS AND DETECTION ACCURACY OF FAKE NEWS HEADLINES ON SOCIAL MEDIA EFFECTS OF TRUTHBIAS AND ENDORSEMENT CUES,"THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES ON MESSAGE CREDIBILITY AND DETECTION ACCURACY OF FAKE AND REAL NEWS AS REPRESENTED ON SOCIAL MEDIA. WE DEVELOPED A DECEPTION DETECTION PARADIGM FOR NEWS HEADLINES AND CONDUCTED TWO ONLINE EXPERIMENTS TO EXAMINE THE EXTENT TO WHICH PEOPLE (1) PERCEIVE NEWS HEADLINES AS CREDIBLE, AND (2) ACCURATELY DISTINGUISH FAKE AND REAL NEWS ACROSS THREE GENERAL TOPICS (I.E., POLITICS, SCIENCE, AND HEALTH). BOTH STUDIES REVEALED THAT PEOPLE OFTEN JUDGED NEWS HEADLINES AS FAKE, SUGGESTING A DECEPTION-BIAS FOR NEWS IN SOCIAL MEDIA. ACROSS STUDIES, WE OBSERVED AN AVERAGE DETECTION ACCURACY OF APPROXIMATELY 51%, A LEVEL CONSISTENT WITH MOST RESEARCH USING THIS DECEPTION DETECTION PARADIGM WITH EQUAL LIE-TRUTH BASE-RATES. STUDY 2 EVALUATED THE EFFECTS OF ENDORSEMENT CUES IN SOCIAL MEDIA (E.G., FACEBOOK LIKES) ON MESSAGE CREDIBILITY AND DETECTION ACCURACY. RESULTS SHOWED THAT HEADLINES ASSOCIATED WITH A HIGH NUMBER OF FACEBOOK LIKES INCREASED CREDIBILITY, THEREBY ENHANCING DETECTION ACCURACY FOR REAL NEWS BUT UNDERMINING ACCURACY FOR FAKE NEWS. THESE STUDIES INTRODUCE TRUTH-DEFAULT THEORY TO THE CONTEXT OF NEWS CREDIBILITY AND ADVANCE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW BIASED PROCESSING OF NEWS INFORMATION CAN IMPACT DETECTION ACCURACY WITH SOCIAL MEDIA ENDORSEMENT CUES.

441,QUALITY OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE VIDEOS ON YOUTUBE AS A SOURCE OF INFORMATION ON SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS,"BACKGROUND: MANY PATIENTS TURN TO ONLINE PLATFORMS TO OBTAIN HEALTHCARE INFORMATION, BUT THE QUALITY AND ACCURACY OF THE INFORMATION IS LARGELY UNKNOWN. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE RELIABILITY AND QUALITY OF THE MOST VIEWED ENGLISH-LANGUAGE YOUTUBE VIDEOS ON SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS (SLE). METHODS: YOUTUBE WAS SEARCHED USING KEYWORDS Ã¢â‚¬Å“SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUSÃ¢â‚¬Â AND VIDEOS WERE CATEGORIZED AS USEFUL INFORMATION, MISLEADING INFORMATION, USEFUL PATIENT OPINION, AND MISLEADING PATIENT OPINION. RELIABILITY WAS SCORED USING A MODIFIED 5-POINT DISCERN TOOL (WHERE HIGHER SCORES REPRESENT GREATER RELIABILITY), WHILE QUALITY WAS RATED USING THE 5-POINT GLOBAL QUALITY SCALE (GQS). CONTENT COVERED INCLUDED EPIDEMIOLOGY, PATHOGENESIS, CLINICAL FEATURES, DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF SLE. RESULTS: OF THE TOP 183 RELEVANT VIDEOS, 124 (67.8%) WERE CLASSIFIED AS USEFUL INFORMATION, 21 (11.5%) AS MISLEADING INFORMATION, 29 (15.8%) AS USEFUL PATIENT OPINION, 9 (4.9%) AS MISLEADING PATIENT OPINION. USEFUL INFORMATION VIDEOS WERE PRIMARILY PRODUCED BY PROFESSIONALS (62.1%), WITH VIDEOS BEING OF GREATER RELIABILITY AND QUALITY THAN OTHER GROUPS. HOWEVER, VIDEO CHARACTERISTICS COLLECTED WERE LARGELY COMPARABLE ACROSS ALL GROUPS. THE MAJORITY (68.9%) OF THE VIDEOS ADDRESSED PATIENTS. CONCLUSION: OUR FINDINGS HIGHLIGHT AN ABUNDANCE OF YOUTUBE VIDEOS WITH USEFUL INFORMATION ON SLE, THAT ARE MOSTLY RELIABLE AND OF HIGH QUALITY. HOWEVER, IN ORDER TO EFFECTIVELY EDUCATE PATIENTS, PITFALLS SUCH AS MISLEADING CONTENT, FALSELY ELEVATED VIDEO CHARACTERISTICS AND NON-PROFESSIONAL SOURCES NEED TO BE MADE KNOWN TO PATIENTS. AS PART OF HOLISTIC CARE, HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS SHOULD ADVISE PATIENTS TO SEEK INFORMATION FROM REPUTED SOURCES.

493,WHO TO TRUST ON SOCIAL MEDIA HOW OPINION LEADERS AND SEEKERS AVOID DISINFORMATION AND ECHO CHAMBERS,"AS TRUST IN NEWS MEDIA AND SOCIAL MEDIA DWINDLES AND FEARS OF DISINFORMATION AND ECHO CHAMBERS SPREAD, INDIVIDUALS NEED TO FIND WAYS TO ACCESS AND ASSESS RELIABLE AND TRUSTWORTHY INFORMATION. DESPITE LOW LEVELS OF TRUST IN SOCIAL MEDIA, THEY ARE USED FOR ACCESSING POLITICAL INFORMATION AND NEWS. IN THIS STUDY, WE EXAMINE THE INFORMATION VERIFICATION PRACTICES OF OPINION LEADERS (WHO CONSUME POLITICAL INFORMATION ABOVE AVERAGE AND SHARE THEIR OPINIONS ON SOCIAL MEDIA ABOVE AVERAGE) AND OF OPINION SEEKERS (WHO SEEK OUT POLITICAL INFORMATION FROM FRIENDS AND FAMILY) TO UNDERSTAND SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES IN THEIR NEWS MEDIA TRUST, FACT-CHECKING BEHAVIORS, AND LIKELINESS OF BEING CAUGHT IN ECHO CHAMBERS. BASED ON A SURVEY OF FRENCH INTERNET USERS (N = 2,000) WE FIND THAT NOT ONLY OPINION LEADERS, BUT ALSO OPINION SEEKERS, HAVE HIGHER RATES ACROSS ALL THREE OF THESE DEPENDENT VARIABLES. WE DISCUSS THE IMPLICATIONS OF FINDINGS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF OPINION LEADERSHIP THEORY AS WELL AS FOR SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS WISHING TO INCREASE TRUST.

142,FOR WHOM THE BOT TOLLS A NEURAL NETWORKS APPROACH TO MEASURING POLITICAL ORIENTATION OF TWITTER BOTS IN RUSSIA,"COMPUTATIONAL PROPAGANDA AND THE USE OF AUTOMATED ACCOUNTS IN SOCIAL MEDIA HAVE RECENTLY BECOME THE FOCUS OF PUBLIC ATTENTION, WITH ALLEGED RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT ACTIVITIES ABROAD PROVOKING PARTICULARLY WIDESPREAD INTEREST. HOWEVER, EVEN IN THE RUSSIAN DOMESTIC CONTEXT, WHERE ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE OF STATE ACTIVITY ONLINE GOES BACK ALMOST A DECADE, NO PUBLIC SYSTEMATIC ATTEMPT HAS BEEN MADE TO DISSECT THE POPULATION OF RUSSIAN SOCIAL MEDIA BOTS BY THEIR POLITICAL ORIENTATION. WE ADDRESS THIS GAP BY DEVELOPING A DEEP NEURAL NETWORK CLASSIFIER THAT SEPARATES PRO-REGIME, ANTI-REGIME, AND NEUTRAL RUSSIAN TWITTER BOTS. OUR METHOD RELIES ON SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING AND A NEW LARGE SET OF LABELED ACCOUNTS, RATHER THAN EXTERNALLY OBTAINED ACCOUNT AFFILIATIONS OR ORIENTATION OF ELITES. WE ALSO ILLUSTRATE THE USE OF OUR METHOD BY APPLYING IT TO BOTS OPERATING IN RUSSIAN POLITICAL TWITTER FROM 2015 TO 2017 AND SHOW THAT BOTH PRO- AND ANTI-KREMLIN BOTS HAD A SUBSTANTIAL PRESENCE ON TWITTER.

488,HOW DO USERS RESPOND TO ONLINE RUMOR REBUTTALS,"UNDERPINNED BY THE STIMULUS-ORGANISM-RESPONSE FRAMEWORK AND THE ANCHORING EFFECT, THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES HOW PERCEIVED MESSAGE PROPERTIES OF ONLINE RUMOR REBUTTALS ARE RELATED TO PERCEIVED UTILITARIAN AND HEDONIC VALUES, WHICH FURTHER COULD DETERMINE REBUTTAL ACCEPTANCE. GIVEN THE POSSIBILITY THAT INTERNET USERS CAN CONFRONT A REBUTTAL WHEN THEY ARE NOT EVEN AWARE OF THE RUMOR, THIS PAPER TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE ROLE OF EXPOSURE SEQUENCE AS A MODERATOR. DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM 322 SOCIAL MEDIA USERS IN A BETWEEN-PARTICIPANTS EXPERIMENT, WHICH MANIPULATED THE EXPOSURE SEQUENCE. PARTIAL LEAST SQUARES STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING WAS USED TO ANALYZE THE DATA. PERCEIVED MESSAGE PROPERTIES WERE POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH PERCEIVED UTILITARIAN AND HEDONIC VALUES, BOTH OF WHICH WERE POSITIVELY RELATED TO REBUTTAL ACCEPTANCE. EXPOSURE SEQUENCE SIGNIFICANTLY MODERATED THE UNDERLYING MECHANISM OF REBUTTAL ACCEPTANCE. THIS PAPER CONTRIBUTES TO THE ONLINE REBUTTAL LITERATURE BY EXAMINING HOW INDIVIDUALS RESPOND TO REBUTTALS IN TERMS OF INTENTION TO BELIEVE AND SHARE SUCH MESSAGES.

449,COUNTERING MISINFORMATION VIA WHATSAPP PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE FROM THE COVID19 PANDEMIC IN ZIMBABWE,"WE EXAMINE HOW INFORMATION FROM TRUSTED SOCIAL MEDIA SOURCES CAN SHAPE KNOWLEDGE AND BEHAVIOR WHEN MISINFORMATION AND MISTRUST ARE WIDESPREAD. IN THE CONTEXT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IN ZIMBABWE, WE PARTNERED WITH A TRUSTED CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATION TO RANDOMIZE THE TIMING OF THE DISSEMINATION OF MESSAGES AIMED AT TARGETING MISINFORMATION ABOUT THE VIRUS TO 27,000 NEWSLETTER WHATSAPP SUBSCRIBERS. WE EXAMINE HOW EXPOSURE TO THESE MESSAGES AFFECTS INDIVIDUALSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ BELIEFS ABOUT HOW TO DEAL WITH THE VIRUS AND PREVENTATIVE BEHAVIOR. IN A SURVEY OF 864 SURVEY RESPONDENTS, WE FIND A 0.26S INCREASE IN KNOWLEDGE ABOUT COVID-19 AS MEASURED BY RESPONSES TO FACTUAL QUESTIONS. THROUGH A LIST EXPERIMENT EMBEDDED IN THE SURVEY, WE FURTHER FIND THAT POTENTIALLY HARMFUL BEHAVIORÃ¢â‚¬â€NOT ABIDING BY LOCKDOWN GUIDELINESÃ¢â‚¬â€DECREASED BY 30 PERCENTAGE POINTS.

THIS SCENARIO HAS BEEN MATTER OF CRITICAL DISCUSSION ABOUT ITS IMPACT ON SOCIETY, MAGNIFIED IN THE CASE OF THE ARAB SPRINGS OR HEAVILY CRITICIZED DURING BREXIT AND THE 2016 U.S. ELECTIONS. IN THIS WORK WE EXPLORE INFORMATION CONSUMPTION ON TWITTER DURING THE 2019 EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN BY ANALYZING THE INTERACTION PATTERNS OF OFFICIAL NEWS OUTLETS, DISINFORMATION OUTLETS, POLITICIANS, PEOPLE FROM THE SHOWBIZ AND MANY OTHERS. WE EXTENSIVELY EXPLORE INTERACTIONS AMONG DIFFERENT CLASSES OF ACCOUNTS IN THE MONTHS PRECEDING THE ELECTIONS, HELD BETWEEN 23RD AND 26TH OF MAY, 2019. WE COLLECTED ALMOST 400,000 TWEETS POSTED BY 863 ACCOUNTS HAVING DIFFERENT ROLES IN THE PUBLIC SOCIETY. THROUGH A THOROUGH QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS WE INVESTIGATE THE INFORMATION FLOW AMONG THEM, ALSO EXPLOITING GEOLOCALIZED INFORMATION. ACCOUNTS SHOW THE TENDENCY TO CONFINE THEIR INTERACTION WITHIN THE SAME CLASS AND THE DEBATE RARELY CROSSES NATIONAL BORDERS.

52,SOCIAL NETWORK SITES EARLY ADOPTERS PERSONALITY AND INFLUENCE,"PURPOSE: THIS PAPER AIMS TO PROVIDE A SOCIAL NETWORK SITE INFLUENCE (SNSI) PROFILE OF EARLY ADOPTERS. THIS STUDY EXPLORES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PERSONALITY TRAITS OF EARLY ADOPTERS OF SOCIAL NETWORK SITES (SNS), THEIR PROPENSITY TO SHARE INFORMATION AND RUMORS AND THEIR GENERAL SNSI. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: AN ONLINE SURVEY WAS SENT TO THE FIRST USERS OF TWITTER (N = 200) AND GOOGLE+ (N = 130) TO ASSESS THEIR PERSONALITY TRAITS. ANSWERS OF EACH RESPONDENT WERE MATCHED TO THEIR SNSI SCORES FROM KLOUT AND PEERINDEX, THE INDUSTRY STANDARD FOR MEASURING SNSI. FINDINGS: EARLY ADOPTERS OF SNS, IN COMPARISON TO MARKET MAVENS, ARE MORE LIKELY TO EXERT INFLUENCE ON ONE PARTICULAR TOPIC RELATED TO THEIR PROFESSION: TECHNOLOGY AND THE INTERNET. THEIR LEVELS OF EXTRAVERSION, OPENNESS AND CONSCIENTIOUSNESS HAVE A POSITIVE AND SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON INFORMATION SHARING, AND A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON RUMOR SHARING. BOTH, INFORMATION SHARING AND RUMOR SHARING HAVE A POSITIVE AND SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE GENERAL SNSI OF EARLY ADOPTERS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: FIRMS STRUGGLE TO DECIDE WHETHER TO INVEST EARLY IN THE LIFE OF NEWLY CREATED SNS AS THEY ARE UNSURE ABOUT THE CHARACTERISTICS OF EARLY ADOPTERS OF SUCH NETWORKS, AND, MORE IMPORTANTLY, WHETHER THESE SITES ARE EFFECTIVE INITIAL VECTORS FOR WORD-OF-MOUTH. THE FINDINGS DEMONSTRATE THAT EARLY ADOPTERSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ INFLUENCE (SNSI SCORE) IS ON PAR WITH THAT OF THE REST OF SNS USERS, SUGGESTING THEIR INFLUENCE MAY BE SOMEWHAT LIMITED. THE STUDY ALSO SHOWS THAT THE OPINION LEADERSHIP IMPACT OF THE MORE INFLUENTIAL EARLY ADOPTERS IS MONOMORPHIC IN NATURE, BEING MAINLY CONFINED TO THE RELATED TECHNOLOGY AND INTERNET DOMAINS.

ALTHOUGH PREVIOUS RESEARCH IDENTIFIED SEVERAL RELIABLE PREDICTORS OF TRUTH JUDGMENTSÃ¢â‚¬â€SUCH AS SOURCE CREDIBILITY, REPEATED INFORMATION EXPOSURE, AND PRESENTATION FORMATÃ¢â‚¬â€LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THEIR SIMULTANEOUS EFFECTS. IN A SERIES OF FOUR EXPERIMENTS, WE INVESTIGATED HOW THE ABOVEMENTIONED FACTORS JOINTLY AFFECT THE PERCEIVED TRUTH OF STATEMENTS (EXPERIMENTS 1 AND 2) AND SIMULATED SOCIAL MEDIA POSTINGS (EXPERIMENTS 3 AND 4). EXPERIMENT 1 EXPLORED THE ROLE OF SOURCE CREDIBILITY (HIGH VS. LOW VS. NO SOURCE INFORMATION) AND PRESENTATION FORMAT (WITH VS. WITHOUT A PICTURE). IN EXPERIMENTS 2 AND 3, WE ADDITIONALLY MANIPULATED REPEATED EXPOSURE (YES VS. NO). FINALLY, EXPERIMENT 4 EXAMINED THE ROLE OF SOURCE CREDIBILITY (HIGH VS. LOW) AND TYPE OF REPETITION (CONGRUENT VS. INCONGRUENT VS. NO REPETITION) IN FURTHER DETAIL. IN SUM, WE FOUND NO EFFECT OF PRESENTATION FORMAT ON TRUTH JUDGMENTS, BUT STRONG, ADDITIVE EFFECTS OF SOURCE CREDIBILITY AND REPETITION. TRUTH JUDGMENTS WERE HIGHER FOR INFORMATION PRESENTED BY CREDIBLE SOURCES THAN NON-CREDIBLE SOURCES AND INFORMATION WITHOUT SOURCES. MOREOVER, CONGRUENT (I.E., VERBATIM) REPETITION INCREASED PERCEIVED TRUTH WHEREAS SEMANTICALLY INCONGRUENT REPETITION DECREASED PERCEIVED TRUTH, IRRESPECTIVELY OF THE SOURCE.

WE IDENTIFIED THE TOP 50 AUTHORS MONTH-OVER-MONTH TO DETERMINE INFLUENTIAL SOURCES OF INFORMATION RELATED TO VACCINE OPPOSITION. RESULTS. THE DATA COLLECTION PERIOD WAS JUNE 1 TO DECEMBER 1, 2019, RESULTING IN 356 594 MENTIONS OF VACCINE OPPOSITION. A TOTAL OF 129 TWITTER AUTHORS MET THE QUALIFICATION OF A TOP AUTHOR IN AT LEAST 1 MONTH. TOP AUTHORS WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR 59.5% OF VACCINE-OPPOSITION MESSAGES. WE IDENTIFIED 10 CONVERSATION THEMES. THEMES WERE SIMILARLY DISTRIBUTED ACROSS TOP AUTHORS AND ALL OTHER AUTHORS MENTIONING VACCINE OPPOSITION. TOP AUTHORS APPEARED TO BE HIGHLY COORDINATED IN THEIR PROMOTION OF MISINFORMATION WITHIN THEMES. CONCLUSIONS. PUBLIC HEALTH HAS STRUGGLED TO RESPOND TO VACCINE MISINFORMATION.

SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS WAS USED TO ANALYZE THE EFFECT OF PEER INFLUENCE ON GM FOOD RUMORMONGERING AT THE GROUP LEVEL, AND WE DID NOT FIND ANY EFFECT THAT USERS WOULD DEPEND ON THEIR FRIENDSHIP NETWORK ON SOCIAL MEDIA TO SPREAD GM FOOD RUMORS. TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF SOCIAL MEDIA EXTRAVERT, REPUTATION AND ATTITUDE ON SCIENTIFIC RUMORMONGERING AT THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL, WE USED LOGISTIC REGRESSION. RESULTS REVEALED THAT PEOPLE WHO HOLD NEGATIVE ATTITUDES TOWARDS GM FOOD AND WHO ARE SOCIAL MEDIA EXTRAVERTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO SPREAD RUMORS, WHILE SOCIAL REPUTATION DID NOT INFLUENCE THE SPREAD OF RUMORS.

536,I DONT KNOW IF IT IS FAKE OR REAL NEWS HOW LITTLE INDONESIAN UNIVERSITY STUDENTS UNDERSTAND SOCIAL MEDIA LITERACY,"CONCERNS OVER FAKE NEWS HAVE BEEN RAISED IN INDONESIA SINCE THERE HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE SPREADING OF FAKE NEWS VIA SOCIAL MEDIA. UNIVERSITY STUDENTS, AS THE MOST ACTIVE SOCIAL MEDIA USERS, ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO CONSUME AND DISTRIBUTE FAKE NEWS. THIS STUDY IS MOTIVATED BY THE ASSUMPTION THAT MEDIA LITERACY INTERVENTIONS HELP USERS RESIST FAKE NEWS. HOWEVER, LIMITED STUDIES HAVE SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSED THEIR LEVEL OF MEDIA LITERACY IN IDENTIFYING FAKE NEWS. USING THE NEW MEDIA LITERACY FRAMEWORK, THIS STUDY ANALYSED THE LEVEL OF MEDIA LITERACY TO PROCESS FAKE NEWS ON SOCIAL MEDIA AMONG UNIVERSITY STUDENTS IN ACEH. A TOTAL OF 500 UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS FROM SYIAH KUALA UNIVERSITY AND AR-RANIRY STATE ISLAMIC UNIVERSITY PARTICIPATED IN THE SURVEY. FOLLOWING THE SURVEY, 28 STUDENTS WERE SELECTED TO TAKE PART IN FOUR FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSIONS. THE FINDINGS SHOWED THAT STUDENTS' DEGREE OF MEDIA LITERACY CONCERNING FAKE NEWS IS RELATIVELY LOW. ALTHOUGH ALMOST ALL STUDENTS DEMONSTRATED A GOOD SKILL IN USING MULTIPLE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS AND UNDERSTANDING INFORMATION THEY RECEIVED, THEY WERE NOT CONFIDENT IN THEIR ABILITIES TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN FAKE AND REAL NEWS. SURPRISINGLY, SOME STUDENTS DELIBERATELY SHARE CONTROVERSIAL POSTS ON SOCIAL MEDIA FOR NO REASON OR TO PLEASE THEMSELVES. THE STUDY SUGGESTS THAT PROGRAM OF MEDIA LITERACY SHOULD EMPHASISE THE IDENTIFICATION OF FAKE NEWS AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF ITS DISTRIBUTION. Ã‚Â© 2020, UNIVERSITI KEBANGSAAN MALAYSIA PRESS.

WE FOCUS ON MERGER RUMORS, WHERE MOST DO NOT MATERIALIZE. WE FIND THAT MERGER RUMORS ACCOMPANIED BY GREATER TWITTER ACTIVITY ELICIT GREATER IMMEDIATE MARKET REACTION EVEN THOUGH RUMOR-RELATED TWITTER ACTIVITY IS UNRELATED TO THE PROBABILITY OF MERGER REALIZATION. THE PRICE DISTORTION ASSOCIATED WITH TWEET VOLUME PERSISTS WEEKS AFTER A RUMOR AND REVERSES ONLY AFTER EIGHT WEEKS. THE PRICE DISTORTION IS MORE PRONOUNCED FOR RUMORS TWEETED BY TWITTER USERS WITH GREATER SOCIAL INFLUENCE, FOR TARGET FIRMS WITH LOW INSTITUTIONAL OWNERSHIP, AND FOR RUMORS THAT SUPPLY MORE DETAILS.

65,QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF PARKINSONS DISEASE INFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA THE CASE OF YOUTUBE,"INTRODUCTION: THERE IS A PAUCITY OF DATA PERTAINING TO THE USEFULNESS OF INFORMATION PRESENTED ON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS ON CHRONIC NEUROPSYCHIATRIC CONDITIONS SUCH AS PARKINSONÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S DISEASE (PD). THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE QUALITY OF YOUTUBEÃ¢â€žÂ¢ VIDEOS THAT DELIVER GENERAL INFORMATION ON PD AND THE AVAILABILITY AND DESIGN OF INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEOS ADDRESSING THE CAREGIVING ROLE IN PD. METHODS: YOUTUBEÃ¢â€žÂ¢ WAS SEARCHED USING THE KEYWORD Ã¢â‚¬Å“PARKINSONÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S DISEASEÃ¢â‚¬Â FOR RELEVANT VIDEOS. VIDEOS WERE ASSESSED FOR USEFULNESS AND ACCURACY BASED ON PRE-DEFINED CRITERIA. DATA ON VIDEO CHARACTERISTICS INCLUDING TOTAL VIEWERSHIP, DURATION, RATINGS, AND SOURCE OF VIDEOS WERE COLLATED. INSTRUCTIONAL PD VIDEOS THAT ADDRESSED THE ROLE OF CAREGIVERS WERE EXAMINED CLOSELY FOR THE DESIGN AND SCOPE OF INSTRUCTIONAL CONTENT. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 100 VIDEOS MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. JUST UNDER A THIRD OF VIDEOS (28%) WAS UPLOADED BY TRUSTED ACADEMIC ORGANISATIONS. OVERALL, 15% OF PD VIDEOS WERE FOUND TO BE SOMEWHAT USEFUL AND ONLY 4% WERE ASSESSED AS PROVIDING VERY USEFUL PD INFORMATION; 3% OF SURVEYED VIDEOS WERE MISLEADING. THE MEAN NUMBER OF VIDEO VIEWS (REGARDLESS OF VIDEO SOURCE) WAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT VIDEO RATINGS (PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.86). ALTHOUGH PERSONAL VIDEOS TRENDED TOWARDS BEING LESS USEFUL THAN VIDEOS FROM ACADEMIC ORGANISATIONS, THIS ASSOCIATION WAS NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.13). CONCLUSION: TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, THIS IS THE FIRST STUDY TO ASSESS THE USEFULNESS OF PD INFORMATION ON THE LARGEST VIDEO-SHARING WEBSITE, YOUTUBEÃ¢â€žÂ¢. IN GENERAL, THE OVERALL QUALITY OF INFORMATION PRESENTED IN THE VIDEOS SCREENED WAS MEDIOCRE. VIEWERSHIP OF ACCURATE VS. MISLEADING INFORMATION WAS, HOWEVER, VERY SIMILAR. THEREFORE, HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS SHOULD DIRECT PD PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES TO THE RESOURCES THAT PROVIDE RELIABLE AND ACCURATE INFORMATION.

b-702,CONSPIRACY BELIEFS AND VACCINATION INTENT FOR COVID19 IN AN INFODEMIC,"BACKGROUND THE MASSIVE, FREE AND UNRESTRICTED EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION ON THE SOCIAL MEDIA DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS SET FERTILE GROUNDS FOR FEAR, UNCERTAINTY AND THE RISE OF FAKE NEWS RELATED TO THE VIRUS. THIS ""VIRAL"" SPREAD OF FAKE NEWS CREATED AN ""INFODEMIC"" THAT THREATENED THE COMPLIANCE WITH PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDELINES AND RECOMMENDATIONS. OBJECTIVE THIS STUDY AIMS TO DESCRIBE THE TRUST IN SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS AND THE EXPOSURE TO FAKE NEWS ABOUT COVID-19 IN LEBANON AND TO EXPLORE THEIR ASSOCIATION WITH VACCINATION INTENT. METHODS IN THIS CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY CONDUCTED IN LEBANON DURING JULY-AUGUST, 2020, A RANDOM SAMPLE OF 1052 PARTICIPANTS SELECTED FROM A MOBILE-PHONE DATABASE RESPONDED TO AN ANONYMOUS STRUCTURED QUESTIONNAIRE AFTER OBTAINING INFORMED CONSENT (RESPONSE RATE = 40%). THE QUESTIONNAIRE WAS CONDUCTED BY TELEPHONE AND MEASURED SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHICS, SOURCES AND TRUST IN SOURCES OF INFORMATION AND EXPOSURE TO FAKE NEWS, SOCIAL MEDIA ACTIVITY, PERCEIVED THREAT AND VACCINATION INTENT. RESULTS RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE MAJORITY OF PARTICIPANTS (82%) BELIEVED THAT COVID-19 IS A THREAT AND 52% HAD INTENTION TO VACCINATE. EXPOSURE TO FAKE/ UNVERIFIED NEWS WAS HIGH (19.7% WERE OFTEN AND 63.8% WERE SOMETIMES EXPOSED, MAINLY TO FAKE NEWS SHARED THROUGH WATSAPP AND FACEBOOK). TRUST IN CERTAIN INFORMATION SOURCES (WHO, MOPH AND TV) INCREASED WHILE TRUST IN OTHERS (WATSAPP, FACEBOOK) REDUCED VACCINATION INTENT AGAINST COVID-19. BELIEVING IN THE MAN-MADE THEORY AND THE BUSINESS CONTROL THEORY SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE LIKELIHOOD OF VACCINATION INTENT (BETA = 0.43; P = 0.01 AND BETA = -0.29; P = 0.05) RESPECTIVELY. CONCLUSION IN THE CONTEXT OF THE INFODEMIC, UNDERSTANDING THE ROLE OF EXPOSURE TO FAKE NEWS AND OF CONSPIRACY BELIEVES IN SHAPING HEALTHY BEHAVIOR IS IMPORTANT FOR INCREASING VACCINATION INTENT AND PLANNING ADEQUATE RESPONSE TO TACKLE THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC.",PLOS ONE,NA,2022,10.1371/journal.pone.0261559,1,0,0,0,0,LEBANON,PLOS ONE

EXACTLY HOW THEY MIGHT LEVERAGE THAT TRUST REMAINS UNCLEAR AND UNTESTED. BUILDING ON RECENT WORK IN CORRECTING HEALTH MISPERCEPTIONS ON SOCIAL MEDIA, THIS STUDY TESTS WHETHER LIBRARIES CAN LEVERAGE TRUST TO COMBAT MISINFORMATION ONLINE. USING A MISPERCEPTION ABOUT THE INFLUENZA VACCINE AS A TEST CASE, AN EXPERIMENT (N = 625) WAS CONDUCTED IN FALL 2018 USING AMAZON'S MECHANICAL TURK. RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE MISPERCEPTION CAN BE REDUCED, BUT NOT BY LIBRARY INSTITUTIONS. AN UNSUCCESSFUL FOLLOW-UP (N = 600) SUGGESTS THAT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE CORRECTION IS SEASON DEPENDENT AND OPENS THE POSSIBILITY THAT LIBRARIES MAY YET PLAY A ROLE, BUT NOT NECESSARILY BECAUSE THEY ARE TRUSTED.

ONLINE DISINFORMATION IS EVERYWHERE, USED AS A POLITICAL WEAPON IN THE BATTLEFIELD OF MANIPULATION. THIS STUDY FOCUSED ON THE PORTUGUESE 2019 ELECTIONS TO ASSESS THE REACH OF FAKE NEWS COMPARED TO MAINSTREAM MEDIA NEWS AND TO VERIFY WHETHER FAKE NEWS HAD SPECIFIC TARGETS. WE REVIEWED ALL POSTS (N=1197) FROM NEWSPAPER FACEBOOK PAGES AND FAKE NEWS FACEBOOK PAGES PUBLISHED DURING THE CAMPAIGN TO VERIFY THEIR ENGAGEMENT. BUZZSUMO ASSESSED POPULARITY BY COUNTING ALL POSTSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ SHARES, REACTIONS AND COMMENTS. IRAMUTEQ SOFTWARE RELATED THE CONTENT OF ALL PUBLISHED HEADLINES BY ANALYZING CLUSTERS OF THE MOST FREQUENT WORDS. FINDINGS SHOW THAT FAKE NEWS HAD NO GREATER REACH THAN REAL NEWS DURING THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN. HOWEVER, FAKE NEWS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE SHARED, WHILE REAL NEWS TEND TO GET MORE REACTIONS AND MORE COMMENTS. IN FAKE NEWS HEADLINES THE TERMS ASSOCIATED WITH LEFT-WING AND GOVERNMENT ARE THE MOST COMMON. THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE SOCIALIST PARTY ARE ASSOCIATED WITH NEGATIVE CONNOTATIONS. RESULTS SUGGEST THAT PORTUGUESE FAKE NEWS ARE RELATED TO RIGHTWING EXTREMISM AND PUBLISH HATE CONTENT TARGETING CORRUPTION AND LEFTIST POLICIES IN GENERAL.

MORE AND MORE PATIENTS ARE SEARCHING FOR INFORMATION ON GENITOURINARY CANCERS VIA TIKTOK. WE AIM TO EVALUATE THE FUNCTIONAL QUALITY AND RELIABILITY OF GENITOURINARY CANCER-RELATED VIDEOS ON IT AND SHARE OUR THOUGHTS BASED ON THE RESULTS FOR BETTER PUBLIC HEALTH PROMOTION. MATERIALS AND METHODS: WE RETRIEVED 167 VIDEOS ON BLADDER, PROSTATE, AND KIDNEY CANCER FROM TIKTOK. ONLY 61 VIDEOS (36.53%) MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA AND WERE EVENTUALLY REGARDED AS SAMPLE VIDEOS. EACH VIDEOÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S LENGTH AND DESCRIPTIONS, HASHTAGS, NUMBER OF VIEWS/LIKES/COMMENTS, FORMS OF EXPRESSION, AND THE UPLOADERÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S PROFILE WERE INCLUDED. THREE VALIDATED ASSESSMENT INSTRUMENTS: THE HEXAGONAL RADAR SCHEMA, THE HEALTH ON THE NET CODE SCALE, AND THE DISCERN INSTRUMENT, WERE USED FOR EVALUATING THE QUALITY AND RELIABILITY OF THE INFORMATION. ALL MISINFORMATION WAS COUNTED AND CATEGORIZED. UNIVARIATE ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE WAS PERFORMED FOR ANALYZING THE RESULTS. THE POST-HOC LEAST SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE TEST WAS CONDUCTED TO EXPLORE FURTHER EXPLANATION. RESULTS: AMONGST 61 SAMPLE VIDEOS, HEALTHCARE PRACTITIONERS CONTRIBUTED THE MOST CONTENT (N = 29, 47.54%). HOWEVER, 22 POSTS (36.07%) WERE MISINFORMATIVE, AND THE MOST COMMON TYPE WAS USING OUTDATED DATA. MORE THAN HALF OF THE VIDEOS COULD PROVIDE GOOD (> 1 POINT) CONTENT ON THE DISEASESÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ SYMPTOMS AND EXAMINATIONS. HOWEVER, THE DEFINITION AND OUTCOMES WERE LESS ADDRESSED (TIED AT 21%). THE HONCODE SCALE AND THE DISCERN INSTRUMENT REVEALED A CONSISTENT CONCLUSION THAT MOST VIDEOS (N = 59, 96.72%) ON TIKTOK WERE OF POOR TO MEDIOCRE QUALITY. VIDEOS PUBLISHED BY MEDIA AGENCIES WERE STATISTICALLY BETTER IN TERMS OF RELIABILITY AND OVERALL SCORE (P = 0.003 AND 0.008, RESPECTIVELY). FIFTY-THREE VIDEOS (86.89%) HAD AT LEAST TWO UNEXPLAINED MEDICAL TERMS. HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS TEND TO USE PROFESSIONAL TERMS MOST (MEAN = 5.28 WORDS). CONCLUSIONS: MOST VIDEOS ON GENITOURINARY CANCERS ON TIKTOK ARE OF POOR TO MEDIUM QUALITY AND RELIABILITY. HOWEVER, VIDEOS POSTED BY MEDIA AGENCIES ENJOYED GREAT PUBLIC ATTENTION AND INTERACTION. MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS COULD IMPROVE THE VIDEO QUALITY BY COOPERATING WITH MEDIA AGENCIES AND AVOIDING UNEXPLAINED TERMINOLOGIES.

443,THE SOURCES AND CORRELATES OF EXPOSURE TO VACCINERELATED MISINFORMATION ONLINE,"OBJECTIVES: TO ASSESS THE QUANTITY AND TYPE OF VACCINE-RELATED INFORMATION AMERICANS CONSUME ONLINE AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO SOCIAL MEDIA USE AND ATTITUDES TOWARD VACCINES. METHODS: ANALYSIS OF INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL WEB BROWSING DATA LINKED WITH SURVEY RESPONSES FROM REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLES OF AMERICANS COLLECTED BETWEEN OCTOBER 2016 AND FEBRUARY 2019. RESULTS: WE ESTIMATE THAT APPROXIMATELY 84% OF AMERICANS VISIT A VACCINE-RELATED WEBPAGE EACH YEAR. ENCOUNTERS WITH VACCINE-SKEPTICAL CONTENT ARE LESS FREQUENT; THEY MAKE UP ONLY 7.5% OF VACCINE-RELATED PAGEVIEWS AND ARE ENCOUNTERED BY ONLY 18.5% OF PEOPLE ANNUALLY. HOWEVER, THESE PAGES ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE PUBLISHED BY UNTRUSTWORTHY SOURCES. MOREOVER, SKEPTICAL CONTENT EXPOSURE IS MORE COMMON AMONG PEOPLE WITH LESS FAVORABLE VACCINE ATTITUDES. FINALLY, USAGE OF ONLINE INTERMEDIARIES IS FREQUENTLY LINKED TO VACCINE-RELATED INFORMATION EXPOSURE. GOOGLE USE IS DIFFERENTIALLY ASSOCIATED WITH SUBSEQUENT EXPOSURE TO NON-SKEPTICAL CONTENT, WHEREAS EXPOSURE TO VACCINE-SKEPTICAL WEBPAGES IS ASSOCIATED WITH USAGE OF WEBMAIL AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, FACEBOOK. CONCLUSIONS: ONLINE EXPOSURE TO VACCINE-SKEPTICAL CONTENT IS RELATIVELY RARE, BUT VIGILANCE IS REQUIRED GIVEN THE POTENTIAL FOR EXPOSURE AMONG VULNERABLE AUDIENCES.

SINCE THE BEGINNING OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC THE EXCHANGE OF MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT SEVERAL TOPICS RELATED TO THIS INFECTIOUS DISEASE AND ITS VACCINATION HAS INCREASED RAPIDLY. THE PURPOSE OF THIS INVESTIGATION WAS TO ASSESS THE CONTENT ASSOCIATED WITH COVID-19 VACCINATION AND ITS SIDE EFFECTS AND EVALUATE ITS EDUCATIONAL QUALITY. METHODS: WE CONDUCTED THIS RETROSPECTIVE STUDY TO INVESTIGATE 600 TWITTER AND INSTAGRAM POSTS BY #COVIDVACCINESIDEEFFECTS DUE TO NUMBER OF Ã¢â‚¬ËœLIKESÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, COMMENTS, TYPE OF POST, LANGUAGE, ITS PURPOSE AND SOURCE. IN ADDITION, POSTS WERE EVALUATED DUE TO EDUCATIONAL QUALITY BY THREE EXAMINERS OF DIFFERENT EDUCATIONAL LEVELS. RESULTS: THE MAJORITY OF POSTS SHOWED 0 TO 50 Ã¢â‚¬Å“LIKESÃ¢â‚¬Â AND 0 TO 5 COMMENTS IN ENGLISH LANGUAGE. A COMPARISON BETWEEN TWITTER AND INSTAGRAM BY THE INFLUENCE OF APPLICATION SHOWED SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN NUMBER OF POSTS AND Ã¢â‚¬Å“LIKESÃ¢â‚¬Â OR COMMENTS (P < 0.05). THE MAJOR POST TYPE WERE TEXTS FOR TWITTER (251; 83.7%) AND VIDEOS FOR INSTAGRAM (104; 34.7%). WHILE A MAJORITY OF POSTS BY #COVIDVACCINESIDEEFFECTS REPORT ABOUT THE OCCURRENCE OF SIDE EFFECTS, THE MAJORITY OF THEM WERE MILD AND GENERAL COVID-19 VACCINATION FEEDBACK DURING THE FIRST 4 MONTHS WAS POSITIVE. BUT, ONLY 3 TO 7% WERE RATED BY Ã¢â‚¬Å“EXCELLENTÃ¢â‚¬Â EDUCATIONAL AND VALIDATABLE CONTENT. INTERRATER RELIABILITY BETWEEN ALL THREE EXAMINERS PRESENTED A HIGH CONCORDANCE WITH 89% (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY PRESENTS AN ANALYSIS OF QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF SOCIAL MEDIA CONTENT ACCORDING TO COVID-19 VACCINATIONS AND ITS SIDE EFFECTS. IT SUPPORTS THE DEDUCTION THAT MOST OF THE CONTENT ON TWITTER AND INSTAGRAM IS SHARED BY PATIENTS AND UNCLEAR SOURCES AND THUS IS LIMITED INFORMATIVE.

b-2402,DETECTING INORGANIC FINANCIAL CAMPAIGNS ON TWITTER,"ONLINE FINANCIAL CONTENT IS WIDESPREAD ON SOCIAL MEDIA, ESPECIALLY ON TWITTER. THE POSSIBILITY TO ACCESS OPEN, REAL-TIME DATA ABOUT STOCK MARKET INFORMATION AND FIRMSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ PUBLIC REPUTATION CAN BRING COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES TO INDUSTRY INSIDERS. HOWEVER, AS MANY STUDIES EXTENSIVELY DEMONSTRATED BEFORE, MANIPULATIVE CAMPAIGNS BY SOCIAL BOTS DO NOT SPARE THE FINANCIAL SECTOR EITHER. IN THIS WORK, WE SHOW THAT THE MORE VIRAL A STOCK IS ON TWITTER, THE MORE THAT VIRALITY IS ARTIFICIALLY CAUSED BY SOCIAL BOTS. THIS RESULT IS ALSO CONFIRMED WHEN CONSIDERING ACCOUNTS SUSPENDED BY TWITTER INSTEAD OF BOTS. STARTING FROM THIS FINDING, WE THEN PROPOSE TWO METHODS FOR DETECTING THE PRESENCE AND THE EXTENT OF FINANCIAL DISINFORMATION ON TWITTER, VIA CLASSIFICATION AND REGRESSION. OUR SYSTEMS EXPLOIT HUNDREDS OF FEATURES TO ENCODE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF VIRAL DISCUSSIONS, INCLUDING FEATURES ABOUT: PARTICIPATING USERS, TEXTUAL CONTENT OF SHARED POSTS, TEMPORAL PATTERNS OF DIFFUSION, AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT STOCKS. WE EXPERIMENT WITH DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS OF ALGORITHMS AND FEATURES, ACHIEVING EXCELLENT RESULTS FOR THE DETECTION OF FINANCIAL DISINFORMATION (F1=0.97) AND PROMISING RESULTS FOR THE CHALLENGING TASK OF ESTIMATING THE EXTENT OF INORGANIC ACTIVITY WITHIN FINANCIAL DISCUSSIONS (R2=0.81, MAE=4.9%).

HOWEVER, THE ABSENCE OF TRADITIONAL JOURNALISTIC GATEKEEPING ALLOWS INFORMATION TO FLOW UNENCUMBERED THROUGH THESE PLATFORMS, OFTEN RAISING QUESTIONS OF VERACITY AND CREDIBILITY OF THE REPORTED INFORMATION. HERE WE ASK: HOW DO THE DYNAMICS OF COLLECTIVE ATTENTION DIRECTED TOWARD AN EVENT REPORTED ON SOCIAL MEDIA VARY WITH ITS PERCEIVED CREDIBILITY? BY EXAMINING THE FIRST LARGE-SCALE, SYSTEMATICALLY TRACKED CREDIBILITY DATABASE OF PUBLIC TWITTER MESSAGES (47M MESSAGES CORRESPONDING TO 1,138 REAL-WORLD EVENTS OVER A PERIOD OF THREE MONTHS), WE ESTABLISHED A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TEMPORAL DYNAMICS OF EVENTS REPORTED ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND THEIR ASSOCIATED LEVEL OF CREDIBILITY JUDGMENTS. REPRESENTING COLLECTIVE ATTENTION BY THE AGGREGATE TEMPORAL SIGNATURES OF AN EVENT'S REPORTAGE, WE FOUND THAT THE AMOUNT OF CONTINUED ATTENTION FOCUSED ON AN EVENT PROVIDES INFORMATION ABOUT ITS ASSOCIATED LEVELS OF PERCEIVED CREDIBILITY. EVENTS EXHIBITING SUSTAINED, INTERMITTENT BURSTS OF ATTENTION WERE FOUND TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER LEVELS OF PERCEIVED CREDIBILITY.

THIS SCHEME WAS ABLE TO IDENTIFY SALIENT FEATURES OF HEALTH MISINFORMATION, INCLUDING EXAGGERATION/ABSOLUTES, INDUCED TEXT, CLAIMS OF BEING UNIQUE AND SECRET, INTEMPERATE TONE OR LANGUAGE, AND STATEMENTS OF EXCESSIVE SIGNIFICANCE AND LIKEWISE. THE SCHEME WAS THEN EVALUATED IN A USER-CENTRED EXPERIMENT TO TEST IF IT IS USEFUL IN IDENTIFYING FEATURES OF HEALTH MISINFORMATION. FORTY-FOUR PARTICIPANTS FOR THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP AND 38 PARTICIPANTS FOR THE CONTROL GROUP PARTICIPATED AND FINISHED THE EXPERIMENT, WHICH COMPARED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE PARTICIPANTS IN USING THE SCHEME TO IDENTIFY HEALTH MISINFORMATION. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE SCHEME IS EFFECTIVE IN TERMS OF IMPROVING USERSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ CAPABILITY IN HEALTH MISINFORMATION IDENTIFICATION. THE RESULTS ALSO INDICATE THAT THE PARTICIPANTSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ CAPABILITY OF RECOGNIZING MISINFORMATION IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED COMPARED TO THOSE OF THE CONTROL GROUP. THE STUDY PROVIDES INSIGHTS INTO HEALTH MISINFORMATION AND HAS IMPLICATIONS IN ENHANCING PEOPLE'S ONLINE HEALTH INFORMATION LITERACY. IT INFORMS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SYSTEM THAT CAN AUTOMATICALLY LIMIT THE SPREAD OF HEALTH MISINFORMATION. MOREOVER, IT POTENTIALLY IMPROVES USERSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ ONLINE HEALTH INFORMATION LITERACY, IN PARTICULAR, UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC.

447,COUNTERING FAKE NEWS A COMPARISON OF POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS REGARDING USER ACCEPTANCE AND EFFECTIVENESS,"SINCE THE EMERGENCE OF SO-CALLED FAKE NEWS ON THE INTERNET AND IN SOCIAL MEDIA, PLATFORMS SUCH AS FACEBOOK HAVE STARTED TO TAKE COUNTERMEASURES, AND RESEARCHERS HAVE BEGUN LOOKING INTO THIS PHENOMENON FROM A VARIETY OF PERSPECTIVES. A LARGE NUMBER OF SCIENTIFIC WORK HAS INVESTIGATED WAYS TO DETECT FAKE NEWS AUTOMATICALLY. LESS ATTENTION HAS BEEN PAID TO THE SUBSEQUENT STEP, I.E., WHAT TO DO WHEN YOU ARE AWARE OF THE INACCURACY OF CLAIMS IN SOCIAL MEDIA. THIS WORK TAKES A USER-CENTERED APPROACH ON MEANS TO COUNTER IDENTIFIED MIS-AND DISINFORMATION IN SOCIAL MEDIA. WE CONDUCT A THREE-STEP STUDY DESIGN ON HOW APPROACHES IN SOCIAL MEDIA SHOULD BE PRESENTED TO RESPECT THE USERS' NEEDS AND EXPERIENCES AND HOW EFFECTIVE THEY ARE. AS OUR FIRST STEP, IN AN ONLINE SURVEY REPRESENTATIVE FOR SOME FACTORS TO THE GERMAN ADULT POPULATION, WE ENQUIRE REGARDING THEIR STRATEGIES ON HANDLING INFORMATION IN SOCIAL MEDIA, AND THEIR OPINION REGARDING POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS-FOCUSING ON THE APPROACH OF DISPLAYING A WARNING ON INACCURATE POSTS. IN A SECOND STEP, WE PRESENT FIVE POTENTIAL APPROACHES FOR COUNTERMEASURES IDENTIFIED IN RELATED WORK TO INTERVIEWEES FOR QUALITATIVE INPUT. WE DISCUSS (1) WARNING, (2) RELATED ARTICLES, (3) REDUCING THE SIZE, (4) COVERING, AND (5) REQUIRING CONFIRMATION. BASED ON THE INTERVIEW FEEDBACK, AS THE THIRD STEP OF THIS STUDY, WE SELECT, IMPROVE, AND EXAMINE FOUR PROMISING APPROACHES ON HOW TO COUNTER MISINFORMATION. WE CONDUCT AN ONLINE EXPERIMENT TO TEST THEIR EFFECTIVENESS ON THE PERCEIVED ACCURACY OF FALSE HEADLINES AND ALSO ASK FOR THE USERS' PREFERENCES. IN THIS STUDY, WE FIND THAT USERS WELCOME WARNING-BASED APPROACHES TO COUNTER FAKE NEWS AND ARE SOMEWHAT CRITICAL WITH LESS TRANSPARENT METHODS. MOREOVER, USERS WANT SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS TO EXPLAIN WHY A POST WAS MARKED AS DISPUTED. THE RESULTS REGARDING EFFECTIVENESS ARE SIMILAR: WARNING-BASED APPROACHES ARE SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING THE PERCEIVED ACCURACY OF FALSE HEADLINES. MOREOVER, ADDING AN EXPLANATION TO THE WARNING LEADS TO THE MOST SIGNIFICANT RESULTS. IN CONTRAST, WE COULD NOT FIND A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON ONE OF FACEBOOK'S CURRENT APPROACHES (REDUCED POST SIZE AND FACT-CHECKS IN RELATED ARTICLES).

WITH THE MUSHROOMING OF SMARTPHONE USERS AND THE EASY ACCESS TO THE INTERNET, FAKE NEWS IS SPREADING AT VERY HIGH SPEED FROM PEOPLE TO PEOPLE. WHY DO PEOPLE FLAGRANTLY BELIEVE FAKE NEWS? WHY DON'T PEOPLE FACT-CHECK BEFORE SHARING INFORMATION WITH OTHERS? ETC., ARE STILL SOME OF THE QUESTIONS UNANSWERED. THE PANIC CREATED BY FAKE NEWS DURING THE TIME OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC OUTBREAK IS ALSO NOT LESS. HENCE, THIS STUDY AIMS TO FOCUS ON UNDERSTANDING PEOPLE'S PERSPECTIVES ON CONTROLLING THE SPREAD OF FAKE NEWS ON SOCIAL MEDIA. THE RESPECTIVE STUDY IS BASED ON QUANTITATIVE DATA ANALYSIS OF THE RESPONSES OF 300 SOCIAL MEDIA USERS ACROSS INDIA, COLLECTED ONLINE IN APRIL 2020 DURING NATIONWIDE LOCKDOWN.THE STUDY ARRIVED AT A CONCLUSION STATING THAT SELF-REGULATION MAY NOT DELIVER A PROPER EFFECT ON CONTROLLING THE SPREAD OF FAKE NEWS. BUT, ORGANISING EFFECTIVE CAMPAIGNS TO BUILD SOCIAL MEDIA LITERACY CAN BE ONE OF THE POTENTIAL MEASURES THAT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED IN ORDER TO CONTROL THE SPREAD OF FAKE NEWS OVER SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS. THE RESPONDENTS OF THE STUDY ALSO AGREE TO BRING-IN A NATIONAL POLICY AND A NATIONAL REGULATORY BODY TO CONTROL THE SPREAD OF FAKE NEWS OVER SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS.

THEREFORE, THIS PAPER IS AIMED AT INVESTIGATING WHY SOCIAL MEDIA USERS SHARE FAKE NEWS ABOUT ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY BRANDS. TO EXAMINE SOCIAL MEDIA USERS' BEHAVIOR TOWARDS ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY BRANDS, A THEORETICAL RESEARCH MODEL PROPOSED AND ANALYZED USING STRUCTURAL EQUATIONS MODELING IN SMARTPLS ON A CONVENIENCE SAMPLE CONSISTING OF 922 QUESTIONNAIRES. DATA WAS COLLECTED BY MEANS OF A QUANTITATIVE-BASED APPROACH VIA A SURVEY CONDUCTED AMONG SOCIAL MEDIA USERS FROM AN EMERGING MARKET. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT SOCIAL MEDIA FLOW HAS A MEDIATED IMPACT ON SHARING FAKE NEWS ABOUT ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY BRANDS ON SOCIAL MEDIA. CONSIDERING THE CRITICAL CONSEQUENCES OF FAKE NEWS, THE PAPER ARGUES THAT UNDERSTANDING THE DISSEMINATION PROCESS OF THIS TYPE OF BOGUS CONTENT ON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS HAS IMPORTANT THEORETICAL AND MANAGERIAL IMPLICATIONS. UNDERSTANDING THE PSYCHOLOGICAL MECHANISMS THAT INFLUENCE PEOPLE'S BEHAVIOR IN SHARING FAKE NEWS ABOUT ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY BRANDS ON SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES (SNS) COULD HELP IN BETTER UNDERSTANDING THE FACTORS AND THE EFFECTS OF THIS PHENOMENON.

THIS CLAIM HAS NOT BEEN ASSESSED BASED ON EVIDENCE. WE EVALUATED IF HEALTH MISINFORMATION BECAME MORE COMMON DURING THE PANDEMIC. WE GATHERED ABOUT 325 MILLION POSTS SHARING URLS FROM TWITTER AND FACEBOOK DURING THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC (MARCH 8-MAY 1, 2020) COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2019. WE RELIED ON SOURCE CREDIBILITY AS AN ACCEPTED PROXY FOR MISINFORMATION ACROSS THIS DATABASE. HUMAN ANNOTATORS ALSO CODED A SUBSAMPLE OF 3000 POSTS WITH URLS FOR MISINFORMATION. POSTS ABOUT COVID-19 WERE 0.37 TIMES AS LIKELY TO LINK TO ""NOT CREDIBLE"" SOURCES AND 1.13 TIMES MORE LIKELY TO LINK TO ""MORE CREDIBLE"" SOURCES THAN PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC. POSTS LINKING TO ""NOT CREDIBLE"" SOURCES WERE 3.67 TIMES MORE LIKELY TO INCLUDE MISINFORMATION COMPARED TO POSTS FROM ""MORE CREDIBLE"" SOURCES. THUS, DURING THE EARLIEST STAGES OF THE PANDEMIC, WHEN CLAIMS OF AN INFODEMIC EMERGED, SOCIAL MEDIA CONTAINED PROPORTIONALLY LESS MISINFORMATION THAN EXPECTED BASED ON THE PRIOR YEAR. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT WIDESPREAD HEALTH MISINFORMATION IS NOT UNIQUE TO COVID-19.

b-2336,USERS ABILITY TO PERCEIVE MISINFORMATION AN INFORMATION QUALITY ASSESSMENT APPROACH,"DIGITAL INFORMATION EXCHANGE ENABLES QUICK CREATION AND SHARING OF INFORMATION AND THUS CHANGES EXISTING HABITS. SOCIAL MEDIA IS BECOMING THE MAIN SOURCE OF NEWS FOR END-USERS REPLACING TRADITIONAL MEDIA. THIS ALSO ENABLES THE PROLIFERATION OF FAKE NEWS, WHICH MISINFORMS READERS AND IS USED TO SERVE THE INTERESTS OF THE CREATORS. AS A RESULT, AUTOMATED FAKE NEWS DETECTION SYSTEMS ARE ATTRACTING ATTENTION. HOWEVER, AUTOMATIC FAKE NEWS DETECTION PRESENTS A MAJOR CHALLENGE; CONTENT EVALUATION IS INCREASINGLY BECOMING THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE END-USER. THUS, IN THE PRESENT STUDY WE USED INFORMATION QUALITY (IQ) AS AN INSTRUMENT TO INVESTIGATE HOW USERS CAN DETECT FAKE NEWS. SPECIFICALLY, WE EXAMINED HOW USERS PERCEIVE FAKE NEWS IN THE FORM OF SHORTER PARAGRAPHS ON INDIVIDUAL IQ DIMENSIONS. WE ALSO INVESTIGATED WHICH USER CHARACTERISTICS MIGHT AFFECT FAKE NEWS DETECTION. WE PERFORMED AN EMPIRICAL STUDY WITH 1123 USERS, WHO EVALUATED RANDOMLY GENERATED STORIES WITH STATEMENTS OF VARIOUS LEVEL OF CORRECTNESS BY INDIVIDUAL IQ DIMENSIONS. THE RESULTS REVEAL THAT IQ CAN BE USED AS A TOOL FOR FAKE NEWS DETECTION. OUR FINDINGS SHOW THAT (1) DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE HAS A POSITIVE IMPACT ON FAKE NEWS DETECTION; (2) EDUCATION IN COMBINATION WITH DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE IMPROVES FAKE NEWS DETECTION; AND (3) PERSONALITY TRAIT CONSCIENTIOUSNESS CONTRIBUTES SIGNIFICANTLY TO FAKE NEWS DETECTION IN ALL DIMENSIONS.

b-2374,CAUGHT IN A NETWORKED COLLUSION HOMOGENEITY IN CONSPIRACYRELATED DISCUSSION NETWORKS ON YOUTUBE,"IN MANY INSTANCES, MISINFORMATION AMONG THE POPULATION MANIFESTS ITSELF IN THE FORM OF CONSPIRACY THEORIES. SERVICES SUCH AS YOUTUBE, WHICH ALLOW THE PUBLICATION OF AUDIOVISUAL MATERIAL IN JUXTAPOSITION WITH PEER RESPONSES (E.G., COMMENTS), FUNCTION AS IDEAL FORUMS TO DISSEMINATE SUCH CONSPIRACY THEORIES AND REACH A MASSIVE AUDIENCE. WHILE PREVIOUS RESEARCH PROVIDED INITIAL EVIDENCE ABOUT THE PREVALENCE OF CONSPIRACY THEORIES IN SOCIAL MEDIA, IT REMAINS UNCLEAR HOW ONLINE NETWORKS DISCUSSING CONSPIRACIST CONTENT ARE STRUCTURED. KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE NETWORK STRUCTURE, HOWEVER, COULD INDICATE TO WHAT EXTENT PEOPLE DISCUSSING CONSPIRACIST IDEAS FACE THE RISK OF BECOMING CAUGHT IN HOMOGENEOUS COMMUNICATION COCOONS. THIS WORK PRESENTS AN APPROACH COMBINING NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING AND NETWORK ANALYSIS TO MEASURE OPINION-BASED HOMOGENEITY OF DISCUSSION NETWORKS OF THREE CONSPIRACY THEORIES (HOLLOW EARTH, CHEMTRAILS, AND NEW WORLD ORDER) ON YOUTUBE. A CLASSIFICATION MODEL WAS USED TO IDENTIFY CONSPIRACY AND COUNTER-CONSPIRACY VIDEOS AND ASSOCIATED USER-GENERATED COMMENTS (N = 123,642), AS WELL AS THE INTERCONNECTIONS BETWEEN THEM. ALTHOUGH CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY VARIED BETWEEN THE INVESTIGATED CONSPIRACY THEORIES, OUR RESULTS INDICATED THAT PEOPLE WHO EXPRESSED A FAVORABLE STANCE TOWARD THE CONSPIRACY THEORY TENDED TO RESPOND TO CONTENT OR INTERACT WITH USERS THAT SHARED THE SAME OPINION. IN CONTRAST, FOR TWO OUT OF THREE CONSPIRACY THEORIES, PEOPLE WHO ADVOCATED AGAINST THE THEORY IN THEIR COMMENTS WERE MORE WILLING TO ENGAGE IN CROSS-CUTTING INTERACTIONS.

82,ISOLATING RUMORS USING SENTIMENT ANALYSIS,"IN RECENT DAYS, SOCIAL MEDIA HAS BECOME A PLATFORM TO SPREAD FALSE FACTS ALL THE WAY THROUGH INTERNET. ONE OF THE GROWING DATA ANALYTIC ENGINE FROM WEB INFORMAL ORGANIZATION SAYS, TWITTER HAS BECOME THE PRIME SOURCE FOR SPREADING FAKE NEWS FACILITATING NUMEROUS PERPETRATORS AROUND THE GLOBE. IT HAS TURNED INTO A COMPETENT, SPEEDY CUM EFFORTLESS HOTSPOT FOR NEWS-FANS TO JUST CLICK AND FORWARD JUNK DATA. INDIVIDUALS ARE OPTING TO USE TWITTER FOR SEARCHING INFORMATION REGARDING CRISIS CIRCUMSTANCES AND EVERYDAY OCCASIONS. IN TWITTER, THE SPREAD OF FRAUDULENT OR INACCURATE INFORMATION DURING THE EMERGENCY SITUATIONS WILL AFFECT THE INDIVIDUALS AND PUBLIC IN NUMEROUS WAYS, BUT THE ORIGINAL NEWS IS MORE RELIABLE WHEN IT IS DECLARED BY THE NEWS CHANNELS. SO, THE IMPORTANCE OF PROPOSED FRAMEWORK IS CATEGORIZED IN THREE STEPS; INITIALLY, TWITTER SCRAPER IS APPLIED TO SCRAPE THE VAST VOLUME OF TWEETS AND METADATA FROM THE COLLECTED SET OF TWEETS FOR THE STUDY ON FORMER CHIEF MINISTER (STATE OF TAMIL NADU) DEATH CASE CONTROVERSY DURING 2016. THEN THE THRESHOLD VALUE BASED ON NEGATIVE POLARITY OF COMMON TWEETS FOR THE SCRAPED DATA IS CALCULATED, ONCE THE TWEETED TEXTS ARE DIFFERENT FROM THE THRESHOLD CONDITION IT WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY TAGGED AS 'RUMOR' (NEGATIVE) OR ELSE TAGGED AS 'NON-RUMOR' (POSITIVE) USING SENTIMENT CLASSIFIER.

518,INTENTIONAL OR INADVERTENT FAKE NEWS SHARING FACTCHECKING WARNINGS AND USERS INTERACTION WITH SOCIAL MEDIA CONTENT,"THE MAIN SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTING STRATEGIES TO MINIMIZE FAKE NEWS DISSEMINATION. THESE INCLUDE IDENTIFYING, LABELING, AND PENALIZING Ã¢â‚¬â€œVIA NEWS FEED RANKING ALGORITHMSÃ¢â‚¬â€œ FAKE PUBLICATIONS. PART OF THE RATIONALE BEHIND THIS APPROACH IS THAT THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF FAKE CONTENT ARISE ONLY WHEN SOCIAL MEDIA USERS ARE DECEIVED. ONCE DEBUNKED, FAKE POSTS AND NEWS STORIES SHOULD THEREFORE BECOME HARMLESS. UNFORTUNATELY, THE LITERATURE SHOWS THAT THE EFFECTS OF MISINFORMATION ARE MORE COMPLEX AND TEND TO PERSIST AND EVEN BACKFIRE AFTER CORRECTION. FURTHERMORE, WE STILL DO NOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT HOW SOCIAL MEDIA USERS EVALUATE CONTENT THAT HAS BEEN FACT-CHECKED AND FLAGGED AS FALSE. MORE WORRYINGLY, PREVIOUS FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT SOME PEOPLE MAY INTENTIONALLY SHARE MADE UP NEWS ON SOCIAL MEDIA, ALTHOUGH THEIR MOTIVATIONS ARE NOT FULLY EXPLAINED. TO BETTER UNDERSTAND USERSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ INTERACTION WITH SOCIAL MEDIA CONTENT IDENTIFIED OR RECOGNIZED AS FALSE, WE ANALYZE QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DATA FROM FIVE FOCUS GROUPS AND A SUB-NATIONAL ONLINE SURVEY (N = 350). FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT THE LABEL OF Ã¢â‚¬ËœFALSE NEWSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ PLAYS A ROLE Ã¢â‚¬â€œALTHOUGH NOT NECESSARILY CENTRALÃ¢â‚¬â€œ IN SOCIAL MEDIA USERSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ EVALUATION OF THE CONTENT AND THEIR DECISION (NOT) TO SHARE IT. SOME PARTICIPANTS SHOWED DISTRUST IN FACT-CHECKERS AND LACK OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE FACT-CHECKING PROCESS.

GROWING EVIDENCE SUPPORTS THE COGNITIVE INVOLVEMENT HYPOTHESIS, WHICH STATES THAT DEEPER REFLECTION AND ELABORATION ON NEWS CONTENT INCREASES ONE'S TENDENCY TO CORRECTLY IDENTIFY FAKE NEWS. THIS STUDY ADDS TO THIS LITERATURE BY EXPLORING CONNECTIONS BETWEEN RELIANCE ON SOCIAL MEDIA FOR NEWS AND EMERGENT SCHOLARSHIP ON THE NEWS FINDS ME PERCEPTION (NFMP). WE ARGUE THAT THE NFMP REPRESENTS A LOW-EFFORT COGNITIVE STYLE OF ATTENTION TO NEWS AND THEREFORE, HIGH NFMP RESPONDENTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO EVALUATE FAKE NEWS AS CREDIBLE. FURTHERMORE, WE EXAMINE WHETHER THIS ASSOCIATION HOLDS DESPITE PARTISAN AFFILIATION. PANEL SURVEY DATA FROM THE UNITED STATES PROVIDE ROBUST EVIDENCE THAT THE NFMP IS ASSOCIATED WITH INACCURATE ASSESSMENTS OF BOTH APOLITICAL AND PRO-CONSERVATIVE FAKE NEWS STORIES. MODERATION ANALYSES SHOW THAT NFMP IS A BOUNDARY CONDITION FOR MEDIA EFFECTS; RELIANCE ON SOCIAL MEDIA FOR NEWS ONLY LEADS TO FAKE NEWS ACCEPTANCE WHEN PEOPLE HOLD THE NFMP, AND THIS EFFECT EXACERBATES PARTISAN MOTIVATED REASONING.

THIS STUDY IS ABOUT TWITTER POSTS THAT MISINTERPRET THIS HYPOTHESIS TO MAKE BASELESS CLAIMS ABOUT BENEFITS OF SMOKING AND VAPING IN THE CONTEXT OF COVID-19. WE QUANTIFY THE PRESENCE OF SUCH MISINFORMATION AND CHARACTERIZE THE TWEETERS WHO POST SUCH MESSAGES. METHODS: TWITTER PREMIUM API WAS USED TO DOWNLOAD TWEETS (N = 17,533) THAT MATCH TERMS INDICATING (A) NICOTINE OR VAPING THEMES, (B) A PROPHYLACTIC OR THERAPEUTIC EFFECT, AND (C) COVID-19 (JANUARY-JULY 2020) AS A CONJUNCTIVE QUERY. A CONSTRAINT ON THE LENGTH OF THE SPAN OF TEXT CONTAINING THE TERMS IN THE TWEETS ALLOWED US TO FOCUS ON THOSE THAT CONVEY THE THERAPEUTIC INTENT. WE HAND-ANNOTATED THESE FILTERED TWEETS AND BUILT A CLASSIFIER THAT IDENTIFIES TWEETS THAT EXTRAPOLATE THE NICOTINE HYPOTHESIS TO SMOKING/VAPING WITH A POSITIVE PREDICTIVE VALUE OF 85%. WE ANALYZED THE FREQUENTLY USED TERMS IN AUTHOR BIOS, TOP WEB LINKS, AND HASHTAGS OF SUCH TWEETS. RESULTS: 21% OF OUR FILTERED COVID-19 TWEETS INDICATE A VAPING OR SMOKING-BASED PREVENTION/TREATMENT NARRATIVE. QUALITATIVE ANALYSES SHOW A VARIETY OF WAYS THERAPEUTIC CLAIMS ARE BEING MADE AND TWEETER BIOS REVEAL PRE-EXISTING NOTIONS OF POSITIVE STANCES TOWARD VAPING. CONCLUSION: THE SOCIAL MEDIA LANDSCAPE IS A DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD IN TOBACCO COMMUNICATION. ALTHOUGH IT INCREASES INFORMATION REACH, CONSUMERS CAN ALSO BE SUBJECT TO CONFIRMATION BIAS WHEN EXPOSED TO INADVERTENT OR DELIBERATE FRAMING OF SCIENTIFIC DISCOURSE THAT MAY BORDER ON MISINFORMATION.

OBJECTIVE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DESCRIBE A COALITION OF HEALTH PROFESSIONALS' APPROACH TO DEVELOPING INFOGRAPHICS ABOUT COVID-19 VACCINES AND THE REACH AND ENGAGEMENT OF THOSE INFOGRAPHICS WHEN SHARED THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA. METHODS: INFOGRAPHICS WERE CREATED BY A CORE TEAM WITHIN THE COALITION FOLLOWING A STEPWISE APPROACH. EACH UNDERWENT A MULTISTEP REVIEW PROCESS, READABILITY EVALUATION, AND TRANSLATION INTO SPANISH. INFOGRAPHICS WERE THEN SHARED THROUGH MULTIPLE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS. THEY WERE GROUPED INTO 1 OF 3 CATEGORIES FOR THIS ANALYSIS: COVID-19 VACCINE SERIES, MYTH DEBUNKERS, OR OTHER. RESULTS: ALL INFOGRAPHICS HAD GREATER OUTREACH, IMPRESSIONS, AND ENGAGEMENT ON TWITTER THAN THEY DID ON OTHER PLATFORMS.

THE MEDIAN PEMAT A/V UNDERSTANDABILITY AND ACTIONABILITY SCORES WERE 50.0% (IQR: 39.1-70.0) AND 66.7% (IQR: 33.3-100.0), RESPECTIVELY. THE MEDIAN MISINFORMATION SCORE RANGED FROM 1.0 TO 3.0. ACCORDING TO GQS, 22 (30.6%), 26 (36.1%), 16 (22.2%), 8 (11.1%) VIDEOS WERE POOR, GENERALLY POOR, MODERATE, AND GOOD, RESPECTIVELY. NO VIDEO WAS EVALUATED AS EXCELLENT. CONCLUSIONS: TODAY, YOUTUBE VIDEOS ON CYSTOSCOPY ARE MORE FREQUENTLY UPLOADED BY HEALTHCARE WORKERS, WHO SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT SPECIFIC ASPECTS OF THIS PROCEDURE. HOWEVER, THE QUALITY OF YOUTUBE CONTENTS ON CYSTOSCOPY IS STILL POOR. THEREFORE, CURRENTLY USERS INTERESTED IN CYSTOSCOPY CANNOT RELY ON YOUTUBE TO GET GOOD INFORMATIVE MATERIAL ON THIS TOPIC. IN CONSEQUENCE, FUTURE AUTHORS SHOULD FOCUS ON IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF VIDEO CONTENTS ON CYSTOSCOPY. Ã‚Â© 2022 EDIZIONI SCRIPTA MANENT S.N.C..

b-474,HESITANCY TOWARDS COVID19 VACCINES ON SOCIAL MEDIA IN CANADA,"TO EFFECTIVELY END THE PANDEMIC, THE ACCEPTANCE OF EFFECTIVE VACCINES AGAINST COVID-19 IS CRITICAL. COMMENTS POSTED IN ONLINE PLATFORMS ACT AS A BAROMETER FOR UNDERSTANDING PUBLIC CONCERNS REGARDING VACCINATION AND CAN BE USED TO INFORM COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES FOR THE 'MOVEABLE MIDDLE'. THE AIM OF THIS EXPLORATORY STUDY WAS TO IDENTIFY ONLINE DIALOGUE REGARDING THE NATURE OF VACCINE HESITANCY RELATED TO COVID-19 VACCINE(S). WE ANALYZED USER COMMENT THREADS IN RESPONSE TO NEWS REPORTS REGARDING COVID-19 VACCINES ON THE CANADIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION NATIONAL NEWS WEBSITE (WITH AS MANY AS 9.4 MILLION UNIQUE VISITORS PER DAY). USER COMMENTS (N = 1145) WERE EXTRACTED FROM 19 ARTICLES BETWEEN MARCH 2020 AND JUNE 15TH, 2020. COMMENTS WERE THEN CODED INDUCTIVELY FOR CONTENT TO ESTABLISH A CODING FRAMEWORK THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY APPLIED TO THE DATASET. OUR DATA PROVIDE EMPIRICAL SUPPORT FOR MISREPRESENTATION AS A FORM OF MISINFORMATION AND FURTHER DEMONSTRATE THE UTILITY OF SOCIAL MEDIA CONTENT AS DATA FOR SOCIAL RESEARCH THAT INFORMS PUBLIC HEALTH COMMUNICATION MATERIALS. THE DATA POINT TO THE NEED FOR, AND VALUE OF, RAPID COMMUNICATION INTERVENTIONS TO FOSTER VACCINE ACCEPTANCE. FALSE INFORMATION WILL CONTINUE TO CREATE CHALLENGES FOR DELIVERING COVID-19 VACCINES. COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES TO GET AHEAD OF THE PACE OF MISINFORMATION ARE CRITICAL, PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF BOOSTERS AND THE POSSIBILITY OF COVID-19 VACCINATION ON AN ANNUAL BASIS.

b-1674,INVESTIGATING FACEBOOKS INTERVENTIONS AGAINST ACCOUNTS THAT REPEATEDLY SHARE MISINFORMATION,"LIKE MANY WEB PLATFORMS, FACEBOOK IS UNDER PRESSURE TO REGULATE MISINFORMATION. ACCORDING TO THE COMPANY, USERS THAT REPEATEDLY SHARE MISINFORMATION (Ã¢â‚¬ËœREPEAT OFFENDERSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢) WILL HAVE THEIR DISTRIBUTION REDUCED, BUT LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION OR THE IMPACTS OF THIS MEASURE. THE FIRST CONTRIBUTION OF THIS PAPER IS TO OFFER A METHODOLOGY TO INVESTIGATE THE IMPLEMENTATION AND CONSEQUENCES OF THIS MEASURE, WHICH RELIES ON AN ANALYSIS COMBINING FACT-CHECKING AND ENGAGEMENT METRICS DATA. USING A SCIENCE FEEDBACK AND A SOCIAL SCIENCE ONE (CONDOR) DATASETS, WE IDENTIFIED A SET OF PUBLIC ACCOUNTS (GROUPS AND PAGES) THAT HAVE SHARED MISINFORMATION REPEATEDLY DURING THE 2019Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2020 PERIOD. WE FIND THAT THE ENGAGEMENT PER POST DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY FOR FACEBOOK PAGES AFTER THEY SHARED TWO OR MORE Ã¢â‚¬ËœFALSE NEWSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. THE MEDIAN DECREASE FOR PAGES IDENTIFIED WITH THE SCIENCE FEEDBACK DATASET IS Ã¢Ë†â€™43%, WHILE THIS VALUE REACHES Ã¢Ë†â€™62% FOR PAGES IDENTIFIED USING THE CONDOR DATASET. IN A DIFFERENT APPROACH, WE IDENTIFIED A SET OF PAGES CLAIMING TO BE UNDER Ã¢â‚¬ËœREDUCED DISTRIBUTIONÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ FOR REPEATEDLY SHARING MISINFORMATION AND HAVING RECEIVED A NOTIFICATION FROM FACEBOOK. WITH THIS SET OF PAGES, WE OBSERVED A MEDIAN DECREASE OF Ã¢Ë†â€™25% IN ENGAGEMENT PER POST AVERAGED OVER 30 DAYS AFTER RECEIVING THE NOTIFICATION MINUS 30 DAYS BEFORE. WE SHOW THAT THIS Ã¢â‚¬ËœREPEAT OFFENDERSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ PENALTY DID NOT APPLY TO FACEBOOK GROUPS. INSTEAD, WE DISCOVER THAT GROUPS HAVE BEEN AFFECTED IN A DIFFERENT WAY WITH A SUDDEN DROP IN THEIR AVERAGE ENGAGEMENT PER POST THAT OCCURRED AROUND JUNE 9, 2020. WHILE THIS DROP HAS CUT THE GROUPSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ ENGAGEMENT PER POST IN ABOUT HALF, THIS DECREASE WAS COMPENSATED BY THE FACT THAT THESE ACCOUNTS HAVE DOUBLED THEIR NUMBER OF POSTS BETWEEN EARLY 2019 AND SUMMER 2020. THE NET RESULT IS THAT THE TOTAL ENGAGEMENT ON POSTS FROM Ã¢â‚¬ËœREPEAT OFFENDERÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ ACCOUNTS (INCLUDING BOTH PAGES AND GROUPS) RETURNED TO ITS EARLY 2019 LEVELS. OVERALL, FACEBOOK'S POLICY THUS APPEARS TO BE ABLE TO CONTAIN THE INCREASE IN MISINFORMATION SHARED BY Ã¢â‚¬ËœREPEAT OFFENDERSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ RATHER THAN TO DECREASE IT.

b-2311,EMPOWERING THE PEOPLES TRUTH THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA DELEGITIMIZING TRUTH CLAIMS OF POPULIST POLITICIANS AND CITIZENS,"RIGHT-WING POPULISTS HAVE ALLEGEDLY FUELED INCREASING LEVELS OF DISTRUST REGARDING EXPERT KNOWLEDGE AND EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE. YET, WE KNOW LITTLE ABOUT HOW RIGHT-WING POPULIST POLITICIANS AND CITIZENS USE SOCIAL MEDIA TO CONSTRUCT AND OPPOSE TRUTH CLAIMS. USING A QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF TWITTER AND FACEBOOK POSTS COMMUNICATED BY RIGHT-WING POPULISTS AND CITIZENS SUPPORTING POPULIST IDEAS IN THE NETHERLANDS, THIS ARTICLE OFFERS IN-DEPTH INSIGHTS INTO PROCESSES OF LEGITIMIZATION (CONFIRMING TRUTH CLAIMS) AND DE-LEGITIMIZATION (OPPOSING TRUTH CLAIMS). THE MAIN CONCLUSION IS THAT RIGHT-WING POPULISTS AND CITIZENS SUPPORTING POPULISM DO NOT SHARE A UNIVERSAL WAY OF REFERRING TO REALITY. THEY USE SOCIAL MEDIA TO COMMUNICATE A CONFIRMATION-BIASED REALITY: EXPERT KNOWLEDGE AND EVIDENCE ARE DE-CONTEXTUALIZED OR REINTERPRETED AND ALIGNED WITH RIGHT-WING POPULIST AGENDAS. REFERENCES TO THE PEOPLEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S EXPERIENCES AND WORLDVIEWS, CONSPIRACY THEORIES AND CRISIS SENTIMENTS ARE USED TO LEGITIMIZE PEOPLEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S OPPOSITION TO EXPERT KNOWLEDGE AND EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE. BASED ON THESE FINDINGS, WE COIN THE IDEA OF AN Ã¢â‚¬Å“ADAPTABLE CONSTRUCTION OF CONFIRMATION-BIASED TRUTH CLAIMSÃ¢â‚¬Â CENTRAL IN RIGHT-WING POPULIST INTERPRETATIONS OF REALITY. IN TIMES OF INCREASING ATTACKS ON EXPERT KNOWLEDGE AND EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE, POPULIST DISCOURSE MAY FUEL AN ANTAGONISM BETWEEN THE ORDINARY PEOPLEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S EXPERIENCES AND THE TRUTH CLAIMS OF ESTABLISHED MEDIA CHANNELS AND POLITICIANS IN GOVERNMENT.

b-2372,UNDERSTANDING THE CHARACTERISTICS OF COVID19 MISINFORMATION COMMUNITIES THROUGH GRAPHLET ANALYSIS,"ONLINE SOCIAL NETWORKS SERVE AS A CONVENIENT WAY TO CONNECT, SHARE, AND PROMOTE CONTENT WITH OTHERS. AS A RESULT, THESE NETWORKS CAN BE USED WITH MALICIOUS INTENT, CAUSING DISRUPTION AND HARM TO PUBLIC DEBATE THROUGH THE SHARING OF MISINFORMATION. HOWEVER, AUTOMATICALLY IDENTIFYING SUCH CONTENT THROUGH ITS USE OF NATURAL LANGUAGE IS A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE COMPARED TO OUR SOLUTION WHICH USES LESS COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES, LANGUAGE-AGNOSTIC AND WITHOUT THE NEED FOR COMPLEX SEMANTIC ANALYSIS. CONSEQUENTLY ALTERNATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY APPROACHES ARE HIGHLY VALUABLE. IN THIS PAPER, WE ASSESS CONTENT THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR MISINFORMATION AND FOCUS ON PATTERNS OF USER ASSOCIATION WITH ONLINE SOCIAL MEDIA COMMUNITIES (SUBREDDITS) IN THE POPULAR REDDIT SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM, AND GENERATE NETWORKS OF BEHAVIOUR CAPTURING USER INTERACTION WITH DIFFERENT SUBREDDITS. WE EXAMINE THESE NETWORKS USING BOTH GLOBAL AND LOCAL METRICS, IN PARTICULAR NOTING THE PRESENCE OF INDUCED SUBSTRUCTURES (GRAPHLETS) ASSESSING 7,876,064 POSTS FROM 96,634 USERS. FROM SUBREDDITS IDENTIFIED AS HAVING POTENTIAL FOR MISINFORMATION, WE NOTE THAT THE ASSOCIATED NETWORKS HAVE STRONGLY DEFINED LOCAL FEATURES RELATING TO NODE DEGREE Ã¢â‚¬â€ THESE ARE EVIDENT BOTH FROM ANALYSIS OF DOMINANT GRAPHLETS AND DEGREE-RELATED GLOBAL METRICS. WE FIND THAT THESE LOCAL FEATURES SUPPORT HIGH ACCURACY CLASSIFICATION OF SUBREDDITS THAT ARE CATEGORISED AS HAVING THE POTENTIAL FOR MISINFORMATION. CONSEQUENTLY WE OBSERVE THAT INDUCED LOCAL SUBSTRUCTURES OF HIGH DEGREE ARE FUNDAMENTAL METRICS FOR SUBREDDIT CLASSIFICATION, AND SUPPORT AUTOMATIC DETECTION CAPABILITIES FOR ONLINE MISINFORMATION INDEPENDENT FROM ANY PARTICULAR LANGUAGE.

WE USE SEVERAL MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS TO DETECT RECRUITMENT MESSAGES IN ONLINE PROPAGANDA, IDENTIFY THEIR DISSEMINATION ON TWITTER, AND QUANTIFY THE REACTIONS OF EXPOSED USERS. ANALYZING CONTENT PRODUCED BY THE ISLAMIC STATE BETWEEN 2015 AND 2016 SHOWS THAT PROPAGANDA CONVEYING THE MATERIAL, SPIRITUAL, AND SOCIAL BENEFITS OF JOINING ISIS INCREASED ONLINE SUPPORT FOR THE GROUP, WHILE CONTENT DISPLAYING BRUTAL VIOLENCE DECREASED ENDORSEMENT OF ISIS ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF VIDEOS.

b-532,SOCIAL MEDIA AND BELIEF IN MISINFORMATION IN MEXICO A CASE OF MAXIMAL PANIC MINIMAL EFFECTS,"CONTRARY TO POPULAR NARRATIVES, IT IS NOT CLEAR WHETHER USING SOCIAL MEDIA FOR NEWS INCREASES BELIEF IN POLITICAL MISINFORMATION. SEVERAL OF THE MOST METHODOLOGICALLY SOUND STUDIES FIND SMALL TO NONEXISTENT EFFECTS. HOWEVER, EXTANT RESEARCH IS LIMITED BY FOCUSING ON FEW PLATFORMS (USUALLY FACEBOOK, TWITTER OR YOUTUBE) AND IS HEAVILY U.S. CENTERED. THIS LEAVES OPEN THE POSSIBILITY THAT OTHER PLATFORMS, SUCH AS THOSE THAT RELY ON VISUAL COMMUNICATION (E.G., INSTAGRAM) OR ARE TAILORED TO STRONG-TIE NETWORK COMMUNICATION (E.G., WHATSAPP), ARE MORE INFLUENTIAL. FURTHERMORE, THE FEW STUDIES CONDUCTED IN OTHER COUNTRIES SUGGEST THAT SOCIAL MEDIA USE INCREASES POLITICAL MISPERCEPTIONS. STILL, THESE WORKS USE CROSS-SECTIONAL DESIGNS, WHICH ARE ILL SUITED TO DEALING WITH OMITTED VARIABLE BIAS AND TEMPORAL ORDERING OF PROCESSES. USING A TWO-WAVE SURVEY FIELDED IN MEXICO DURING THE 2021 MIDTERM ELECTIONS (N = 596), WE ESTIMATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FREQUENCY OF NEWS EXPOSURE ON FACEBOOK, TWITTER, YOUTUBE, INSTAGRAM AND WHATSAPP, AND BELIEF IN POLITICAL MISINFORMATION, WHILE CONTROLLING FOR BOTH TIME-INVARIANT AND TIME-DEPENDENT INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES. I N CONTRAST TO POLITICAL DISCUSSION, INFORMATION LITERACY AND DIGITAL SKILLS, NONE OF THE SOCIAL PLATFORMS ANALYZED EXHIBITS A SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATION WITH MISINFORMED BELIEFS. WE ALSO TESTED FOR POSSIBLE INDIRECT, MODERATED, AND RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIPS, BUT NONE OF THESE ANALYSES YIELDED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT RESULT.

METHODS: WE IDENTIFIED 172 ANTI-AND PRO-VACCINE FACEBOOK PAGES AND COLLECTED POSTS FROM THESE PAGES SIX MONTHS BEFORE AND AFTER THE POLICY. USING INTERRUPTED TIME SERIES REGRESSION MODELS, WE EVALUATED THE POLICY IMPACT ON USER ENDORSEMENTS (I.E., LIKES) OF ANTI-AND PRO-VACCINE POSTS ON FACEBOOK. RESULTS: THE NUMBER OF LIKES FOR POSTS ON ANTI-VACCINE PAGES HAD DECREASED AFTER THE POLICY IMPLEMENTA-TION (POLICY = 153.2, P < 0.05; POLICY*DAY =-0.838, P < 0.05; MARGINAL EFFECT AT THE MEAN =-22.74, P < 0.01; MARGINAL EFFECT AT THE MEDIAN =-24.56, P < 0.01). WHEN THE NUMBER OF SUBSCRIBERS WAS CONSID-ERED, THE POLICY EFFECT ON THE NUMBER OF LIKES FOR ANTI-VACCINE POSTS WAS MUCH SMALLER, BUT STILL STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (POLICY = 4.849, P < 0.05; POLICY*DAY =-0.027, P < 0.05; MARGINAL EFFECT AT THE MEAN =-0.742, P < 0.01; MARGINAL EFFECT AT THE MEDIAN =-0.800, P < 0.01). THERE WAS NO POLICY EFFECT OBSERVED FOR POSTS ON PRO-VACCINE PAGES. CONCLUSIONS: OUR ANALYSIS SUGGESTED THAT FACEBOOK'S MARCH 2019 VACCINE MISINFORMATION POLICY MODER-ATELY IMPACTED THE NUMBER OF ENDORSEMENTS OF ANTI-VACCINE CONTENT ON ITS PLATFORM. SOCIAL MEDIA COM-PANIES CAN TAKE MEASURES TO LIMIT THE POPULARITY OF ANTI-VACCINE CONTENT BY REDUCING THEIR REACH AND VISIBILITY.

USING A PAIR OF SURVEY EXPERIMENTS, WE EXAMINE WHETHER FALSE TAGS AND JOURNALISTIC FACTCHECKS REDUCE ACCURACY MISPERCEPTIONS AND SHARING PROPENSITY ON SOCIAL MEDIA THAT CAN SPREAD FALSE CLAIMS. FALSE TAGS HAD LITTLE EFFECT ON SUBJECTS' ACCURACY ASSESSMENTS AND SOCIAL MEDIA SHARING. JOURNALISTIC FACTCHECKS THAT OFFER ACCURATE INFORMATION TO COUNTER MISINFORMATION WERE MORE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING BOTH MISPERCEPTIONS AND SHARING ON SOCIAL MEDIA. FURTHER, WE FIND NO EVIDENCE OF PARTISAN BACKFIRE EFFECTS, EVEN IN RESPONSE TO INTERVENTIONS AGAINST CLAIMS WITH A PLAUSIBLE PARTISAN VALENCE.

WE EXAMINE COVID-19 MISINFORMATION ON REDDIT FOLLOWING VACCINE SCIENTIFIC ANNOUNCEMENTS, IN THE INITIAL PHASES OF THE VACCINE TIMELINE. METHODS WE COLLECTED ALL POSTS ON REDDIT (REDDIT.COM) FROM JANUARY 1 2020 - DECEMBER 14 2020 (N=266,840) THAT CONTAINED BOTH COVID-19 AND VACCINE-RELATED KEYWORDS. WE USED TOPIC MODELING TO UNDERSTAND CHANGES IN WORD PREVALENCE WITHIN TOPICS AFTER THE RELEASE OF VACCINE TRIAL DATA. SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS WAS ALSO CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN REDDIT COMMUNITIES (SUBREDDITS) THAT SHARED COVID-19 VACCINE POSTS, AND THE MOVEMENT OF POSTS BETWEEN SUBREDDITS. RESULTS THERE WAS AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN A PFIZER PRESS RELEASE REPORTING 90% EFFICACY AND INCREASED DISCUSSION ON VACCINE MISINFORMATION. WE OBSERVED AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN JOHNSON AND JOHNSON TEMPORARILY HALTING ITS VACCINE TRIALS AND REDUCED MISINFORMATION. WE FOUND THAT INFORMATION SKEPTICAL OF VACCINATION WAS FIRST POSTED IN A SUBREDDIT (R/CORONAVIRUS) WHICH FAVORED ACCURATE INFORMATION AND THEN REPOSTED IN SUBREDDITS ASSOCIATED WITH ANTIVACCINE BELIEFS AND CONSPIRACY THEORIES (E.G. CONSPIRACY, NONEWNORMAL). CONCLUSIONS OUR FINDINGS CAN INFORM THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERVENTIONS WHERE INDIVIDUALS DETERMINE THE ACCURACY OF VACCINE INFORMATION, AND COMMUNICATIONS CAMPAIGNS TO IMPROVE COVID-19 VACCINE PERCEPTIONS, EARLY IN THE VACCINE TIMELINE. SUCH EFFORTS CAN INCREASE INDIVIDUAL- AND POPULATION-LEVEL AWARENESS OF ACCURATE AND SCIENTIFICALLY SOUND INFORMATION REGARDING VACCINES AND THEREBY IMPROVE ATTITUDES ABOUT VACCINES, ESPECIALLY IN THE EARLY PHASES OF VACCINE ROLL-OUT.

IN ADDITION, WE FOUND THAT THE FACT-CHECKING LABEL EFFECTIVELY DECREASED VACCINE CONSPIRACY BELIEFS AND MISINFORMATION ENGAGEMENT INTENTIONS FOR THOSE WHOSE PRIOR FAVORABLE ATTITUDES TOWARD MMR VACCINATION WERE RELATIVELY LOW. BASED ON OUR FINDINGS, WE SUGGEST THAT PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND HEALTH COMMUNICATORS USE THE FACT-CHECKING LABEL AS A PROMISING TOOL FOR COUNTERING CONSPIRACY THEORIES ABOUT VACCINATION.

WE FOUND THAT ASKING USERS TO RATE ARTICLES USING A SELF-REFERENTIAL QUESTION INDUCED THEM TO THINK MORE CRITICALLY-AS INDICATED BY INCREASED ACTIVATION IN THE MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX AND DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX-AND MADE THEM LESS LIKELY TO BELIEVE THE ARTICLES. THE EFFECT EXTENDED TO SUBSEQUENT ARTICLES; AFTER BEING ASKED TO RATE AN ARTICLE, USERS WERE LESS LIKELY TO BELIEVE OTHER ARTICLES THAT FOLLOWED IT WHETHER THEY WERE ASKED TO RATE THEM OR NOT. OVERALL, OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT ASKING USERS TO EVALUATE THE TRUTHFULNESS OF ARTICLES USING SELF-REFERENTIAL RATING QUESTIONS MAY NOT ONLY PRODUCE RATING INFORMATION THAT COULD BE USED BY OTHERS LATER IN TIME, BUT ALSO HAS AN IMMEDIATE BENEFIT OF INDUCING USERS TO THINK MORE CRITICALLY ABOUT ALL ARTICLES THEY SEE.",INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH,NA,2022,https://doi.org/10.1287/isre.2021.1090,5,4,1,0,0,USA,INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH

ALL OVER THE WORLD, PEOPLE HAVE BEEN URGED TO TAKE PROTECTIVE MEASURES. IT IS HOPED THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF WIDESPREAD VACCINATION CAMPAIGNS WILL DEFEAT THE PANDEMIC IN THE LONG TERM. WHILE MANY PEOPLE ARE EAGER TO BE VACCINATED AGAINST COVID-19, OTHER VOICES IN THE POPULATION ARE HIGHLY CRITICAL OF VACCINATION AND PROTECTIVE MEASURES, CIRCULATING MUCH MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA. THE MOVEMENTS OPPOSING PANDEMIC RESPONSE MEASURES ARE HETEROGENEOUS, INCLUDING RIGHT-WING GROUPS, SPIRITUALISTS WHO DENY SCIENCE, CITIZENS WITH EXISTENTIAL FEARS, AND THOSE WHO EQUATE VACCINATION WITH A LOSS OF INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM. THIS STUDY AIMS TO MAP AND COMPARE THE SOCIAL MEDIA COMMUNICATION OF ANTI-VACCINATION MOVEMENTS THAT DEFY SOCIAL COHESION AND CIRCULATE ONLINE MISINFORMATION IN GERMANY AND BRAZIL. BY FOLLOWING A GROUNDED THEORY APPROACH SUGGESTED BY WEBB AND MALLON (2007), WE CODED CONTENT FROM SOCIAL MEDIA COMMUNICATION OF OPINION LEADERS ON TWITTER WITH EXTENDED NARRATIVE ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY FINDING DIFFERENT NARRATIVES THAT WERE MAPPED WITHIN THE INHOMOGENEOUS ANTI-VACCINATION MOVEMENTS.

PROPOSED SOLUTIONS RANGE FROM ENCOURAGING MORE SELECTIVE SHARING BY INDIVIDUALS TO REMOVING FALSE CONTENT AND ACCOUNTS THAT CREATE OR PROMOTE IT. HERE WE PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK TO EVALUATE INTERVENTIONS AIMED AT REDUCING VIRAL MISINFORMATION ONLINE BOTH IN ISOLATION AND WHEN USED IN COMBINATION. WE BEGIN BY DERIVING A GENERATIVE MODEL OF VIRAL MISINFORMATION SPREAD, INSPIRED BY RESEARCH ON INFECTIOUS DISEASE. BY APPLYING THIS MODEL TO A LARGE CORPUS (10.5 MILLION TWEETS) OF MISINFORMATION EVENTS THAT OCCURRED DURING THE 2020 US ELECTION, WE REVEAL THAT COMMONLY PROPOSED INTERVENTIONS ARE UNLIKELY TO BE EFFECTIVE IN ISOLATION. HOWEVER, OUR FRAMEWORK DEMONSTRATES THAT A COMBINED APPROACH CAN ACHIEVE A SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTION IN THE PREVALENCE OF MISINFORMATION.

b-1587,CONSTITUENTS INFERENCES OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS GOALS AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POLITICAL PARTY AND BELIEF IN COVID19 MISINFORMATION CROSSSECTIONAL SURVEY OF TWITTER FOLLOWERS OF STATE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS,"BACKGROUND: AMID THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, SOCIAL MEDIA HAVE INFLUENCED THE CIRCULATION OF HEALTH INFORMATION. PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCIES OFTEN USE TWITTER TO DISSEMINATE AND AMPLIFY THE PROPAGATION OF SUCH INFORMATION. STILL, EXPOSURE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT-ENDORSED COVID-19 PUBLIC HEALTH INFORMATION DOES NOT MAKE ONE IMMUNE TO BELIEVING MISINFORMATION. MOREOVER, NOT ALL HEALTH INFORMATION ON TWITTER IS ACCURATE, AND SOME USERS MAY BELIEVE MISINFORMATION AND DISINFORMATION JUST AS MUCH AS THOSE WHO ENDORSE MORE ACCURATE INFORMATION. THIS SITUATION IS COMPLICATED, GIVEN THAT ELECTED OFFICIALS MAY PURSUE A POLITICAL AGENDA OF RE-ELECTION BY DOWNPLAYING THE NEED FOR COVID-19 RESTRICTIONS. THE POLITICALLY POLARIZED NATURE OF INFORMATION AND MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA IN THE UNITED STATES HAS FUELED A COVID-19 INFODEMIC. BECAUSE PRE-EXISTING POLITICAL BELIEFS CAN BOTH FACILITATE AND HINDER PERSUASION, TWITTER USERS' BELIEF IN COVID-19 MISINFORMATION IS LIKELY A FUNCTION OF THEIR GOAL INFERENCES ABOUT THEIR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES' MOTIVES FOR ADDRESSING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. OBJECTIVE: WE SHED LIGHT ON THE COGNITIVE PROCESSES OF GOAL UNDERSTANDING THAT UNDERLIE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PARTISANSHIP AND BELIEF IN HEALTH MISINFORMATION. WE INVESTIGATE HOW THE VALENCE OF TWITTER USERS' GOAL INFERENCES OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS' COVID-19 EFFORTS PREDICTS THEIR BELIEF IN COVID-19 MISINFORMATION AS A FUNCTION OF THEIR POLITICAL PARTY AFFILIATION. METHODS: WE CONDUCTED A WEB-BASED CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY OF US TWITTER USERS WHO FOLLOWED THEIR STATE'S OFFICIAL DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TWITTER ACCOUNT (N=258) BETWEEN AUGUST 10 AND DECEMBER 23, 2020. INFERENCES ABOUT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS' GOALS, DEMOGRAPHICS, AND BELIEF IN COVID-19 MISINFORMATION WERE MEASURED. STATE POLITICAL AFFILIATION WAS CONTROLLED. RESULTS: PARTICIPANTS FROM ALL 50 STATES WERE INCLUDED IN THE SAMPLE. AN INTERACTION EMERGED BETWEEN POLITICAL PARTY AFFILIATION AND GOAL INFERENCE VALENCE FOR BELIEF IN COVID-19 MISINFORMATION (ÃŽâ€R2=0.04; F8,249=4.78; P<.001); POSITIVE GOAL INFERENCE VALENCE PREDICTED INCREASED BELIEF IN COVID-19 MISINFORMATION AMONG REPUBLICANS (ÃŽâ€™=.47; T249=2.59; P=.01) BUT NOT AMONG DEMOCRATS (ÃŽâ€™=.07; T249=0.84; P=.40). CONCLUSIONS: OUR RESULTS REVEAL THAT FAVORABLE INFERENCES ABOUT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS' COVID-19 EFFORTS CAN ACCELERATE BELIEF IN MISINFORMATION AMONG REPUBLICAN-IDENTIFYING CONSTITUENTS. IN OTHER WORDS, ACCURATE COVID-19 TRANSMISSION KNOWLEDGE IS A FUNCTION OF CONSTITUENTS' SENTIMENT TOWARD POLITICIANS RATHER THAN SCIENCE, WHICH HAS SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS ON PUBLIC HEALTH EFFORTS FOR MINIMIZING THE SPREAD OF THE DISEASE, AS CONVINCING MISINFORMED CONSTITUENTS TO PRACTICE SAFETY MEASURES MIGHT BE A POLITICAL ISSUE JUST AS MUCH AS IT IS A HEALTH ONE. OUR WORK SUGGESTS THAT GOAL UNDERSTANDING PROCESSES MATTER FOR MISINFORMATION ABOUT COVID-19 AMONG REPUBLICANS. THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR FUTURE COVID-19 PUBLIC HEALTH MESSAGING AIMED AT INCREASING BELIEF IN VALID INFORMATION ABOUT COVID-19 SHOULD RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO TEST PERSUASIVE APPEALS THAT ADDRESS PARTISANS' PRE-EXISTING POLITICAL VIEWS IN ORDER TO PREVENT INDIVIDUALS' GOAL INFERENCES FROM INTERFERING WITH PUBLIC HEALTH MESSAGING.

AT THE SAME TIME, POLITICAL POLARIZATION HAS ALSO BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH THE SPREAD OF MISINFORMATION. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE THEORETICAL LINKAGES BETWEEN POLARIZATION AND MISINFORMATION AND MEASURES THE FLOW OF MISINFORMATION ABOUT COVID-19 IN THE COMMENT SECTIONS OF FOUR POPULAR YOUTUBE CHANNELS FOR OVER 16 MONTHS USING BIG DATA SOURCES AND METHODS. FOR THE ANALYSIS, WE DOWNLOADED ABOUT 3.5M ENGLISH LANGUAGE YOUTUBE COMMENTS POSTED IN RESPONSE TO VIDEOS ABOUT THE PANDEMIC. WE THEN CLASSIFIED THE COMMENTS INTO ONE OF THE TWO FOLLOWING CATEGORIES BY APPLYING A SUPERVISED NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING CLASSIFIER: (1) FAKE: COMMENTS THAT CONTAIN CLAIMS AND SPECULATION WHICH ARE VERIFIABLY NOT TRUE; AND (2) LEGITIMATE: COMMENTS THAT DO NOT FALL INTO THE FAKE CATEGORY. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE LEVEL OF MISINFORMATION IN YOUTUBE COMMENT SECTIONS HAS INCREASED DURING THE PANDEMIC, THAT FAKE COMMENTS ATTRACT STATISTICALLY MORE LIKES, AND THAT THE RATIO OF FAKE COMMENTS INCREASED BY 0.4% PER MONTH. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT ONCE INTRODUCED INTO AN ONLINE DISCUSSION, MISINFORMATION POTENTIALLY LEADS TO AN ESCALATING SPIRAL OF MISINFORMATION COMMENTS, WHICH UNDERMINES PUBLIC POLICY. OVERALL, THE RESULTS SIGNAL ALARMING PANDEMIC-RELATED MISINFORMATION AND, POTENTIALLY, RISING LEVELS OF AFFECTIVE POLARIZATION.

METHODS: TROLL TWEETS (N = 1959) OBTAINED FROM TWITTER IN 2020 WERE CODED FOR VACCINE MISINFORMATION (ÃŽâ€˜ = 0.77Ã¢â‚¬â€œ0.97). DESCRIPTIVE, BIVARIATE, AND MULTIVARIABLE NEGATIVE BINOMIAL REGRESSIONS WERE APPLIED TO ESTIMATE ROBUST INCIDENCE RATE RATIOS (IRRS) AND 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS (95 %CI) OF VACCINE MISINFORMATION ASSOCIATIONS WITH TWEET CHARACTERISTICS AND ENGAGEMENT (I.E., REPLIES, LIKES, RETWEETS). RESULTS: MISINFORMATION ABOUT PERSONAL DANGERS (43.0%), CIVIL LIBERTY VIOLATIONS (20.2%), AND VACCINE CONSPIRACIES (18.6%) WERE COMMON. MORE MISINFORMATION TWEETS USED ANTI-VACCINATION LANGUAGE (97.3% VS. 13.2%) AND REFERENCED SYMPTOMS (37.4% VS. 0.5%) THAN NON-MISINFORMATION TWEETS. FEWER MISINFORMATION TWEETS REFERENCED CREDIBLE SOURCES (14.0% VS. 19.5%), WERE FORMATTED AS HEADLINES (39.2% VS. 77.0%), AND MENTIONED SPECIFIC VACCINES (11.3% VS. 36.1%, ALL P < 0.01) THAN NON-MISINFORMATION TWEETS.

SOME OF THIS MAY STEM FROM EARLY REPORTS SUGGESTING A LOWER RISK OF SEVERE COVID-19 IN NICOTINE USERS. ADDITIONALLY, A COMMON CONSPIRACY IS THAT THE E-CIGARETTE OR VAPING PRODUCT USE-ASSOCIATED LUNG INJURY (EVALI) OUTBREAK OF 2019 WAS ACTUALLY AN EARLY PRESENTATION OF COVID-19. THIS MAY HAVE IMPORTANT PUBLIC HEALTH RAMIFICATIONS FOR BOTH COVID-19 CONTROL AND ENDS USE. OBJECTIVE: TWITTER IS AN IDEAL TOOL FOR ANALYZING REAL-TIME PUBLIC DISCUSSIONS RELATED TO BOTH ENDS AND COVID-19. THIS STUDY SEEKS TO COLLECT AND CLASSIFY TWITTER MESSAGES (""TWEETS"") RELATED TO ENDS AND COVID-19 TO INFORM PUBLIC HEALTH MESSAGING. METHODS: APPROXIMATELY 2.1 MILLION TWEETS MATCHING ENDS-RELATED KEYWORDS WERE COLLECTED FROM MARCH 1, 2020, THROUGH JUNE 30, 2020, AND WERE THEN FILTERED FOR COVID-19-RELATED KEYWORDS, RESULTING IN 67,321 ORIGINAL TWEETS. A 5% (N=3366) SUBSAMPLE WAS OBTAINED FOR HUMAN CODING USING A SYSTEMATICALLY DEVELOPED CODEBOOK. TWEETS WERE CODED FOR RELEVANCE TO THE TOPIC AND FOUR OVERARCHING CATEGORIES. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 1930 (57.3%) TWEETS WERE CODED AS RELEVANT TO THE RESEARCH TOPIC. HALF (N=1008, 52.2%) OF THESE DISCUSSED A PERCEIVED ASSOCIATION BETWEEN ENDS USE AND COVID-19 SUSCEPTIBILITY OR SEVERITY, WITH 42.4% (N=818) SUGGESTING THAT ENDS USE IS ASSOCIATED WITH WORSE COVID-19 SYMPTOMS. ONE-QUARTER (N=479, 24.8%) OF TWEETS DISCUSSED THE PERCEIVED SIMILARITY/DISSIMILARITY OF COVID-19 AND EVALI, AND 13.8% (N=266) DISCUSSED ENDS USE BEHAVIOR. MISINFORMATION AND CONSPIRACY THEORIES WERE PRESENT THROUGHOUT ALL CODING CATEGORIES. CONCLUSIONS: DISCUSSIONS ABOUT ENDS USE AND COVID-19 ON TWITTER FREQUENTLY HIGHLIGHT CONCERNS ABOUT THE SUSCEPTIBILITY AND SEVERITY OF COVID-19 FOR ENDS USERS; HOWEVER, MANY CONTAIN MISINFORMATION AND CONSPIRACY THEORIES.

WITH THE AIM OF REDUCING THE IMPACT ON SOCIAL DISRUPTION, WE SHOW THAT NOT ONLY MISINFORMATION BUT ALSO CORRECTIVE INFORMATION CAN CAUSE SOCIAL DISRUPTION, AND WE CLARIFY HOW TO CONTROL THE SPREAD OF THE LATTER TO LIMIT ITS IMPACT. WE ANALYZED THE MISINFORMATION ABOUT A TOILET-PAPER SHORTAGE AND ITS CORRECTION AS WELL AS THE SOCIAL DISRUPTION THIS EVENT CAUSED IN JAPAN DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IN 2020.

METHODS: A SEARCH WAS PERFORMED IN THE VIDEO SHARING PLATFORM YOUTUBE WITH THE KEYWORD Ã¢â‚¬Å“DIABETIC FOOT CAREÃ¢â‚¬Â ON 09.12.2020. FROM 200 VIDEOS, 87 WERE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY, AND THEY WERE INDEPENDENTLY EVALUATED BY TWO INVESTIGATORS FOR THEIR USEFULNESS, RELIABILITY, AND QUALITY. RESULTS: OF THE VIDEOS, 8% WERE CATEGORIZED AS VERY USEFUL, 33.3% MODERATELY USEFUL, 51.7% SOMEWHAT USEFUL, AND 6.9% NOT USEFUL, WHILE 4.6% CONTAINED MISLEADING INFORMATION. IT WAS ALSO FOUND THAT THE INSTRUCTOR WAS A NURSE IN ONLY 12.6% OF THESE VIDEOS. CONCLUSION: THERE IS USEFUL INFORMATION ABOUT DIABETIC FOOT CARE ON YOUTUBE; HOWEVER, THERE ARE ALSO VIDEOS WITH MISLEADING INFORMATION.

USING A LARGE DATA SET OF 604,269 SOCIAL MEDIA MENTIONS SOURCED FROM POPULAR SOCIAL PLATFORMS (EG TWITTER AND REDDIT), THIS STUDY SET OUT TO DISCOVER THEMES ASSOCIATED WITH MISINFORMATION AND THE FACEBOOK ADVERTISING BOYCOTT THAT OCCURRED IN JULY 2020. TO UNDERSTAND THE DISCOURSE, A LINGUISTIC ANALYSIS APPROACH CALLED THEME EXTRACTION WAS USED. THIS METHOD EMPLOYS MACHINE LEARNING AND NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TO REVEAL RELATIONSHIPS IN THE DATA THAT MAY OTHERWISE BE BURIED IN THE MASS OF SOCIAL MEDIA MENTIONS. THE MOST PROMINENT THEME IDENTIFIED AMONG SOCIAL MEDIA USERS WAS THE DESIRE THAT FACEBOOK AND OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS ACTIVELY STOP THE SPREAD OF MISINFORMATION. OTHER TRENDING TOPICS INCLUDED #STOPHATEFORPROFIT, LOCKDOWN PROTESTS, HATE SPEECH POLICY, NEWS AS SPAM, RIGHT-WING POLITICS AND SUSPENDED ADS.

b-1610,MISINFORMATION ON DIGITAL PLATFORMS QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF CONTENT FROM TWITTER AND SINA WEIBO IN THE COVID19 PANDEMIC,"BACKGROUND: MISINFORMATION ABOUT COVID-19 ON SOCIAL MEDIA HAS PRESENTED CHALLENGES TO PUBLIC HEALTH AUTHORITIES DURING THE PANDEMIC. THIS PAPER LEVERAGES QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE CONTENT ANALYSIS ON CROSS-PLATFORM, CROSS-NATIONAL DISCOURSE AND MISINFORMATION IN THE CONTEXT OF COVID-19. SPECIFICALLY, WE INVESTIGATED COVID-19-RELATED CONTENT ON TWITTER AND SINA WEIBO - THE LARGEST MICROBLOGGING SITES IN THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA, RESPECTIVELY. OBJECTIVE: USING DATA FROM 2 PROMINENT MICROBLOGGING PLATFORM, TWITTER, BASED IN THE UNITED STATES, AND SINA WEIBO, BASED IN CHINA, WE COMPARED THE CONTENT AND RELATIVE PREVALENCE OF MISINFORMATION TO BETTER UNDERSTAND PUBLIC DISCOURSE OF PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES ACROSS SOCIAL MEDIA AND CULTURAL CONTEXTS. METHODS: A TOTAL OF 3,579,575 POSTS WERE SCRAPED FROM BOTH SINA WEIBO AND TWITTER, FOCUSING ON CONTENT FROM JANUARY 30, 2020, WITHIN 24 HOURS OF WHEN WHO DECLARED COVID-19 A ""PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY OF INTERNATIONAL CONCERN,""AND A WEEK LATER, ON FEBRUARY 6, 2020. WE EXAMINED HOW THE USE AND ENGAGEMENT MEASURED BY KEYWORD FREQUENCIES AND HASHTAGS DIFFER ACROSS THE 2 PLATFORMS. A 1% RANDOM SAMPLE OF TWEETS THAT CONTAINED BOTH THE ENGLISH KEYWORDS ""CORONAVIRUS""AND ""COVID-19""AND THE EQUIVALENT CHINESE CHARACTERS WAS EXTRACTED AND ANALYZED BASED ON CHANGES IN THE FREQUENCIES OF KEYWORDS AND HASHTAGS AND THE VITERBI ALGORITHM. WE MANUALLY CODED A RANDOM SELECTION OF 5%-7% OF THE CONTENT TO IDENTIFY MISINFORMATION ON EACH PLATFORM AND COMPARED POSTS USING THE WHO FACT-CHECK PAGE TO ADJUDICATE ACCURACY OF CONTENT. RESULTS: BOTH PLATFORMS POSTED ABOUT THE OUTBREAK AND TRANSMISSION, BUT POSTS ON SINA WEIBO WERE LESS LIKELY TO REFERENCE TOPICS SUCH AS WHO, HONG KONG, AND DEATH AND MORE LIKELY TO CITE THEMES OF RESISTING, FIGHTING, AND CHEERING AGAINST CORONAVIRUS. MISINFORMATION CONSTITUTED 1.1% OF TWITTER CONTENT AND 0.3% OF SINA WEIBO CONTENT - ALMOST 4 TIMES AS MUCH ON TWITTER COMPARED TO SINA WEIBO. CONCLUSIONS: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF CONTENT ON BOTH PLATFORMS POINTS TO LOWER DEGREES OF MISINFORMATION, MORE CONTENT DESIGNED TO BOLSTER MORALE, AND LESS REFERENCE TO TOPICS SUCH AS WHO, DEATH, AND HONG KONG ON SINA WEIBO THAN ON TWITTER.

b-1613,UNDERSTANDING HOW AND BY WHOM COVID19 MISINFORMATION IS SPREAD ON SOCIAL MEDIA CODING AND NETWORK ANALYSES,"BACKGROUND: DURING GLOBAL HEALTH CRISES SUCH AS THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, RAPID SPREAD OF MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA HAS OCCURRED. THE MISINFORMATION ASSOCIATED WITH COVID-19 HAS BEEN ANALYZED, BUT LITTLE ATTENTION HAS BEEN PAID TO DEVELOPING A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK TO STUDY ITS SPREAD ON SOCIAL MEDIA. OBJECTIVE: WE PROPOSE AN ELABORATION LIKELIHOOD MODELÃ¢â‚¬â€œBASED THEORETICAL MODEL TO UNDERSTAND THE PERSUASION PROCESS OF COVID-19Ã¢â‚¬â€œRELATED MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA. METHODS: THE PROPOSED MODEL INCORPORATES THE CENTRAL ROUTE FEATURE (CONTENT FEATURE) AND PERIPHERAL FEATURES (INCLUDING CREATOR AUTHORITY, SOCIAL PROOF, AND EMOTION). THE CENTRAL-LEVEL COVID-19Ã¢â‚¬â€œRELATED MISINFORMATION FEATURE INCLUDES FIVE TOPICS: MEDICAL INFORMATION, SOCIAL ISSUES AND PEOPLEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S LIVELIHOODS, GOVERNMENT RESPONSE, EPIDEMIC SPREAD, AND INTERNATIONAL ISSUES. FIRST, WE CREATED A DATA SET OF COVID-19 PANDEMICÃ¢â‚¬â€œRELATED MISINFORMATION BASED ON FACT-CHECKING SOURCES AND A DATA SET OF POSTS THAT CONTAINED THIS MISINFORMATION ON REAL-WORLD SOCIAL MEDIA. BASED ON THE COLLECTED POSTS, WE ANALYZED THE DISSEMINATION PATTERNS. RESULTS: OUR DATA SET INCLUDED 11,450 MISINFORMATION POSTS, WITH MEDICAL MISINFORMATION AS THE LARGEST CATEGORY (N=5359, 46.80%). MOREOVER, THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT BOTH THE LEAST (4660/11,301, 41.24%) AND MOST (2320/11,301, 20.53%) ACTIVE USERS ARE PRONE TO SHARING MISINFORMATION. FURTHER, POSTS RELATED TO INTERNATIONAL TOPICS THAT HAVE THE GREATEST CHANCE OF PRODUCING A PROFOUND AND LASTING IMPACT ON SOCIAL MEDIA EXHIBITED THE HIGHEST DISTRIBUTION DEPTH (MAXIMUM DEPTH=14) AND WIDTH (MAXIMUM WIDTH=2355). ADDITIONALLY, 97.00% (2364/2437) OF THE SPREAD WAS CHARACTERIZED BY RADIATION DISSEMINATION. CONCLUSIONS: OUR PROPOSED MODEL AND FINDINGS COULD HELP TO COMBAT THE SPREAD OF MISINFORMATION BY DETECTING SUSPICIOUS USERS AND IDENTIFYING PROPAGATION CHARACTERISTICS.

IN PARTICULAR, DISINFORMATION IN THE HEALTH CARE SECTOR CAN LEAD TO SERIOUS CASUALTIES, AS THE CURRENT COVID-19 CRISIS CLEARLY SHOWS. OBJECTIVE: THE MAIN AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXPERIMENTALLY EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE SOURCE AND A PROTECTIVE WARNING MESSAGE ON USERSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ CRITICAL EVALUATION OF NEWS ITEMS, AS WELL AS THE PERCEPTION OF ACCURACY OF THE NEWS ITEM. METHODS: A 3 (UNRELIABLE VS RELIABLE VS NO IDENTIFIED SOURCE) Ãƒâ€” 2 (WITH PROTECTIVE MESSAGE VS WITHOUT) BETWEEN-SUBJECT DESIGN WAS CONDUCTED AMONG 307 PARTICIPANTS (MEAN AGE 29 (SD 10.9] YEARS). RESULTS: THE RESULTS SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT OF SOURCE INFORMATION ON CRITICAL EVALUATION. IN ADDITION, INCLUDING A PROTECTIVE MESSAGE DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT CRITICAL EVALUATION. THE RESULTS SHOWED NO INTERACTION BETWEEN TYPE OF SOURCE AND PROTECTIVE MESSAGE ON CRITICAL EVALUATION. CONCLUSIONS: BASED ON THESE RESULTS, IT IS QUESTIONABLE WHETHER INCLUDING PROTECTIVE MESSAGES TO IMPROVE CRITICAL EVALUATION IS A WAY TO MOVE FORWARD AND IMPROVE CRITICAL EVALUATION OF HEALTH-RELATED NEWS ITEMS, ALTHOUGH EFFECTIVE METHODOLOGIES TO TACKLE THE SPREAD OF DISINFORMATION ARE HIGHLY NEEDED.

METHODS: SEVERAL FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSIONS WERE CONDUCTED INVOLVING PHARMACIST PARTICIPANTS PURPOSIVELY RECRUITED. THE DISCUSSIONS WERE AUDIOTAPED AND THEMATICALLY ANALYSED. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 41 PHARMACISTS PARTICIPATED IN THIS STUDY. THE MOST FREQUENT MISINFORMATION ON SM WAS RELATED TO THE USE OF HERBAL MEDICINES. THE MISINFORMATION TENDED TO DECREASE MEDICATION COMPLIANCE, INCREASE DELAYED TREATMENT, AND WORSEN THE ILLNESS. PARTICIPANTS REPORTED DIFFICULTY IN SEEKING RELIABLE REFERENCES ABOUT TRADITIONAL AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINES. THEY WERE OFTEN ASKED FOR ADVICE AND OPINION RELATED TO INFORMATION ON SM. CONCLUSION: PHARMACISTS NEED TO COUNTERACT THE HEALTH MISINFORMATION ON SM ACTIVELY. LACK OF REFERENCE TO A PARTICULAR TOPIC IS A SIGNIFICANT OBSTACLE.

b-1682,SOCIAL MEDIA ENGAGEMENT WITH TRANSGENDER FERTILITY CONTENT,"OBJECTIVE: TO IDENTIFY TRANSGENDER FERTILITY CONTENT WITH THE HIGHEST ONLINE ENGAGEMENT ON SOCIAL MEDIA, DETERMINE ITS ACCURACY AND QUALITY, AND SEE HOW THIS HAS CHANGED OVER A 2-YEAR PERIOD. DESIGN: BUZZSUMO, A CONTENT RESEARCH TOOL, WAS USED TO IDENTIFY THE TOP 10 ARTICLE LINKS RELATED TO TRANSGENDER FERTILITY MOST INTERACTED WITH ON THE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS OF FACEBOOK, TWITTER, PINTEREST, AND REDDIT. WE COMPARED ARTICLE LINKS FROM JUNE 2019 TO JUNE 2020 AND FROM JUNE 2020 TO JUNE 2021. THE ARTICLES WERE CATEGORIZED AS ACCURATE OR MISLEADING BASED ON THE REFERENCES CITED AND CURRENT RESEARCH. A QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED USING ARTICLE REFERENCES TO SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE AND JOURNAL IMPACT FACTORS. USER ENGAGEMENT WAS COMPARED WITH THE ACCURACY OF ONLINE INFORMATION USING DESCRIPTIVE AND ÃŽÂ§2 STATISTICS. SETTING: NOT APPLICABLE. PATIENT(S): NOT APPLICABLE. INTERVENTION(S): NOT APPLICABLE. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): NOT APPLICABLE. RESULT(S): THE TOP 10 ARTICLE LINKS FOR EACH TIME PERIOD WERE EXAMINED, WITH 7,077 TOTAL ENGAGEMENTS. FOURTEEN ARTICLES REFERENCED 14 UNIQUE SCIENTIFIC STUDIES; NO REFERENCES WERE AVAILABLE FOR THE REMAINING 6 ARTICLES. ALTERNATIVE MEDIA WAS THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF POPULAR ARTICLE LINKS, AND ACCURATE ARTICLES ACCOUNTED FOR 74% OF THE TOTAL ENGAGEMENTS. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF ENGAGEMENTS WITH ACCURATE ARTICLES AND THE TIME PERIODS USED FOR ANALYSIS (P < .0001). CONCLUSION(S): AS THE POPULARITY OF SOCIAL MEDIA CONTINUES TO RISE, PATIENTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO TURN TO ONLINE PLATFORMS IN SEARCH OF INFORMATION AND ADVICE REGARDING FERTILITY. TRANSGENDER FERTILITY IS AN EMERGING TOPIC COVERED BY SCIENTIFIC PEER-REVIEWED JOURNALS, NEWS ORGANIZATIONS, AND ALTERNATIVE MEDIA, AND IT IS IMPERATIVE FOR INTERNET USERS TO CONSIDER THE ACCURACY OF THE INFORMATION PRESENTED BY SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS. FURTHER, REPRODUCTIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY AND INFERTILITY PHYSICIANS SHOULD USE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS TO EDUCATE THEIR PATIENTS ON THE TOPIC OF TRANSGENDER FERTILITY AND PREVENT THE SPREAD OF MISINFORMATION.

b-1990,THE MODERATION OF HUMAN CHARACTERISTICS IN THE CONTROL MECHANISMS OF RUMOURS IN SOCIAL MEDIA THE CASE OF FOOD RUMOURS IN CHINA,"SOCIAL NETWORKS ARE WIDELY USED AS A FAST AND UBIQUITOUS INFORMATION-SHARING MEDIUM. THE MASS SPREAD OF FOOD RUMOURS HAS SERIOUSLY INVADED PUBLICÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S HEALTHY LIFE AND IMPACTED FOOD PRODUCTION. IT CAN BE ARGUED THAT THE GOVERNMENT, COMPANIES, AND THE MEDIA HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO SEND TRUE ANTI-RUMOUR MESSAGES TO REDUCE PANIC, AND THE RISKS INVOLVED IN DIFFERENT FORMS OF COMMUNICATION TO THE PUBLIC HAVE NOT BEEN PROPERLY ASSESSED. THE MANUSCRIPT DEVELOPS AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS MODEL FROM 683 FOOD ANTI-RUMOUR CASES AND 7,967 DATA OF THE USERS WITH TOP COMMENTS TO TEST THE INFLUENCE OF THE STRENGTH OF RUMOUR/ANTI-RUMOUR ON RUMOUR CONTROL. FURTHERMORE, DIVIDING THE USERS INTO THREE CATEGORIES, LEADERS, CHATTERS, AND GENERAL PUBLIC, AND STUDY THE INFLUENCE OF HUMAN CHARACTERISTICS ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE STRENGTH OF RUMOUR/ANTI-RUMOUR AND RUMOUR CONTROL BY CONSIDERING THE DIFFERENT HUMAN CHARACTERISTICS AS MODERATOR VARIABLES. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT ANTI-RUMOURS HAVE A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE CONTROL OF RUMOURS; THE AMBIGUITY OF RUMOURS HAS A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE POSITIVE COMMENT INDEX (PCI) IN RUMOUR CONTROL. FURTHER, THE LEADERS INCREASED THE OVERALL LEVEL OF PCI, BUT NEGATIVELY ADJUSTED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EVIDENCE AND PCI; THE CHATTERS AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC REDUCED THE OVERALL LEVEL OF PCI, AND CHATTERS WEAKENED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SPECIFIC TYPE OF ANTI-RUMOUR FORM AND PCI WHILE THE GENERAL PUBLIC ENHANCED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SPECIFIC TYPE OF ANTI-RUMOUR FORM AND PCI. IN THE LONG RUN, THE ROLE OF LEADERS NEEDS TO BE FURTHER IMPROVED, AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC IS GROWING IN THE FOOD RUMOUR CONTROL PROCESS.

BUILDING AN INTERACTIVE WEBSITE, AS A COMMON UMBRELLA TO THEIR MANY BRANDS CAN PRODUCE A SUCCESSFUL CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE LEADING TO SATISFACTION AND BRAND LOYALTY. THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES E-LOYALTY TOWARD MULTI-BRAND WEBSITES THAT AGGREGATE, ON A SINGLE WEBSITE, BRANDS AND PRODUCTS BELONGING TO THE SAME PARENT COMPANY (CORPORATE BRAND). USING A QUASI-EXPERIMENT ON TWO MAJOR CORPORATE MULTI-BRAND WEBSITES, THE STUDY UNCOVERS A POSITIVE MULTI-BRAND EXPERIENCE EFFECT COMING FROM THE BENEFITS OF HAVING MULTIPLE BRANDS ON THE SAME SITE. THE MULTI-BRAND EXPERIENCE ON E-LOYALTY IS STRONGER FOR FIRST-TIME VISITORS COMPARED TO REPEAT VISITORS AND E-LOYALTY INCREASES WITH THE NUMBER OF BRANDS PURCHASED BEFORE VISITING THE WEBSITE.

653,"THE ROLE OF SOCIAL MEDIA IN SPREADING PANIC AMONG PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC: AN ONLINE QUESTIONNAIRE STUDY FROM THE GAZA STRIP, PALESTINE","COVID-19, INFODEMIC, SOCIAL MEDIA PANIC, SCHOOL STUDENTS, MENTAL HEALTH, GAZA STRIP, PALESTINE Â© 2020BACKGROUND: THE RAPID OUTBREAK OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS OPENED UP VARIOUS ISSUES ON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS AMONG SCHOOL STUDENTS. THE DANGEROUS ISSUE IS THAT MISINFORMATION, FAKE NEWS, AND RUMOURS SPREAD ON SOCIAL MEDIA FASTER THAN RELIABLE INFORMATION, AND ALSO FASTER THAN THE VIRUS ITSELF, DAMAGING THE HEALTH SYSTEMS AND AFFECTING THE MENTAL HEALTH OF SOCIAL MEDIA USERS. OBJECTIVE: THE CURRENT STUDY AIMS AT DETERMINING HOW SOCIAL MEDIA AFFECTS THE SPREAD OF PANIC ABOUT COVID-19 AMONG PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS IN THE GAZA STRIP, PALESTINE. METHODS: THE DATA WERE COLLECTED THROUGH AN ONLINE QUESTIONNAIRE. BY UTILIZING CONVENIENCE SAMPLING, WE HAVE REACHED A TOTAL OF 1067 SCHOOL STUDENTS, AGED BETWEEN 6 AND 18 YEARS, FROM 56 SCHOOLS LOCATED IN THE GAZA STRIP, PALESTINE. INDEPENDENT SAMPLES T-TEST, ANOVA, AND CHI-SQUARE TESTS WERE USED TO COMPARE THE DATA. RESULTS: THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT SOCIAL MEDIA HAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON SPREADING PANIC ABOUT COVID-19 AMONG SCHOOL STUDENTS, WITH A POTENTIAL NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THEIR MENTAL HEALTH AND PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING. FACEBOOK WAS THE MOST COMMON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM AMONG STUDENTS (81.8%), WHERE FEMALE STUDENTS HAD A HIGHER LIKELIHOOD THAN MALE STUDENTS TO USE IT TO GET NEWS ABOUT COVID-19 (P < 0.001). HEALTH NEWS WAS THE MOST FREQUENTLY TOPIC SEEN, READ, OR HEARD (N = 529, 56.2%) DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, WHERE MALES WERE MORE LIKELY TO FOLLOW HEALTH NEWS THAN FEMALES (P < 0.001). THE MAJORITY OF THE STUDENTS (N = 736, 78.1%) WERE PSYCHOLOGICALLY AFFECTED, WHEREAS THOSE PHYSICALLY AFFECTED WERE THE LOWEST (N = 12, 1.3%). FEMALE STUDENTS WERE PSYCHOLOGICALLY AFFECTED AND EXPERIENCED GREATER FEAR SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THAN MALE STUDENTS (P < 0.001). THE EFFECT OF SOCIAL MEDIA PANIC DEPENDING ON A STUDENT'S AGE AND GENDER. (P < 0.001). THIS STUDY SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN SOCIAL MEDIA AND SPREADING PANIC ABOUT COVID-19 (R = 0.891). CONCLUSIONS: DURING THE CLOSURE OF SCHOOLS, STUDENTS ARE USING SOCIAL MEDIA TO CONTINUE THEIR LEARNING AS WELL AS TO KNOW MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE COVID-19 OUTBREAK. SOCIAL MEDIA HAS A MAIN ROLE IN RAPIDLY SPREADING OF PANIC ABOUT THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AMONG STUDENTS IN THE GAZA STRIP.

659,COVID-19 MISINFORMATION SPREAD IN EIGHT COUNTRIES: EXPONENTIAL GROWTH MODELING STUDY,"BACKGROUND: THE EPIDEMIC OF MISINFORMATION ABOUT COVID-19 TRANSMISSION, PREVENTION, AND TREATMENT HAS BEEN GOING ON SINCE THE START OF THE PANDEMIC. HOWEVER, DATA ON THE EXPOSURE AND IMPACT OF MISINFORMATION IS NOT READILY AVAILABLE. OBJECTIVE: WE AIM TO CHARACTERIZE AND COMPARE THE START, PEAK, AND DOUBLING TIME OF COVID-19 MISINFORMATION TOPICS ACROSS 8 COUNTRIES USING AN EXPONENTIAL GROWTH MODEL USUALLY EMPLOYED TO STUDY INFECTIOUS DISEASE EPIDEMICS. METHODS: COVID-19 MISINFORMATION TOPICS WERE SELECTED FROM THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION MYTHBUSTERS WEBSITE. DATA REPRESENTING EXPOSURE WAS OBTAINED FROM THE GOOGLE TRENDS APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE FOR 8 ENGLISH-SPEAKING COUNTRIES. EXPONENTIAL GROWTH MODELS WERE USED IN MODELING TRENDS FOR EACH COUNTRY. RESULTS: SEARCHES FOR â€œCORONAVIRUS AND 5Gâ€ STARTED AT DIFFERENT TIMES BUT PEAKED IN THE SAME WEEK FOR 6 COUNTRIES. SEARCHES FOR 5G ALSO HAD THE SHORTEST DOUBLING TIME ACROSS ALL MISINFORMATION TOPICS, WITH THE SHORTEST TIME IN NIGERIA AND SOUTH AFRICA (APPROXIMATELY 4-5 DAYS). SEARCHES FOR â€œCORONAVIRUS AND GINGERâ€ STARTED AT THE SAME TIME (THE WEEK OF JANUARY 19, 2020) FOR SEVERAL COUNTRIES, BUT PEAKS WERE INCONGRUENT, AND SEARCHES DID NOT ALWAYS GROW EXPONENTIALLY AFTER THE INITIAL WEEK. SEARCHES FOR â€œCORONAVIRUS AND SUNâ€ HAD DIFFERENT START TIMES ACROSS COUNTRIES BUT PEAKED AT THE SAME TIME FOR MULTIPLE COUNTRIES. CONCLUSIONS: PATTERNS IN THE START, PEAK, AND DOUBLING TIME FOR â€œCORONAVIRUS AND 5Gâ€ WERE DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER MISINFORMATION TOPICS AND WERE MOSTLY CONSISTENT ACROSS COUNTRIES ASSESSED, WHICH MIGHT BE ATTRIBUTABLE TO A LACK OF PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF 5G TECHNOLOGY. UNDERSTANDING THE SPREAD OF MISINFORMATION, SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES ACROSS DIFFERENT CONTEXTS CAN HELP IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF APPROPRIATE INTERVENTIONS FOR LIMITING ITS IMPACT SIMILAR TO HOW WE ADDRESS INFECTIOUS DISEASE EPIDEMICS. FURTHERMORE, THE RAPID PROLIFERATION OF MISINFORMATION THAT DISCOURAGES ADHERENCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTIONS COULD BE PREDICTIVE OF FUTURE INCREASES IN DISEASE CASES.

660,CRITICAL IMPACT OF SOCIAL NETWORKS INFODEMIC ON DEFEATING CORONAVIRUS COVID-19 PANDEMIC: TWITTER-BASED STUDY AND RESEARCH DIRECTIONS,"NEWS CREATION AND CONSUMPTION HAS BEEN CHANGING SINCE THE ADVENT OF SOCIAL MEDIA. AN ESTIMATED 2.95 BILLION PEOPLE IN 2019 USED SOCIAL MEDIA WORLDWIDE. THE WIDESPREAD OF THE CORONAVIRUS COVID-19 RESULTED WITH A TSUNAMI OF SOCIAL MEDIA. MOST PLATFORMS WERE USED TO TRANSMIT RELEVANT NEWS, GUIDELINES AND PRECAUTIONS TO PEOPLE. ACCORDING TO WHO, UNCONTROLLED CONSPIRACY THEORIES AND PROPAGANDA ARE SPREADING FASTER THAN THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ITSELF, CREATING AN INFODEMIC AND THUS CAUSING PSYCHOLOGICAL PANIC, MISLEADING MEDICAL ADVISES, AND ECONOMIC DISRUPTION. ACCORDINGLY, DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN INITIATED WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF MODERATING ALL COVID-19'S COMMUNICATIONS, EXCEPT THOSE INITIATED FROM TRUSTED SOURCES SUCH AS THE WHO AND AUTHORIZED GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES. THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS A LARGE-SCALE STUDY BASED ON DATA MINED FROM TWITTER. EXTENSIVE ANALYSIS HAS BEEN PERFORMED ON APPROXIMATELY ONE MILLION COVID-19 RELATED TWEETS COLLECTED OVER A PERIOD OF TWO MONTHS. FURTHERMORE, THE PROFILES OF 288,000 USERS WERE ANALYZED INCLUDING UNIQUE USERS' PROFILES, META-DATA AND TWEETS' CONTEXT. THE STUDY NOTED VARIOUS INTERESTING CONCLUSIONS INCLUDING THE CRITICAL IMPACT IN TERM OF REACH LEVEL OF THE (1) EXPLOITATION OF THE COVID-19 CRISIS TO REDIRECT READERS TO IRRELEVANT TOPICS AND (2) WIDESPREAD OF UNAUTHENTIC MEDICAL PRECAUTIONS AND INFORMATION. FURTHER DATA ANALYSIS REVEALED THE IMPORTANCE OF USING SOCIAL NETWORKS IN A GLOBAL PANDEMIC CRISIS BY RELYING ON CREDIBLE USERS WITH VARIETY OF OCCUPATIONS, CONTENT DEVELOPERS AND INFLUENCERS IN SPECIFIC FIELDS.

670,INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN SUSCEPTIBILITY TO FALSE MEMORIES FOR COVID-19 FAKE NEWS,"EXPOSURE TO â€˜FAKE NEWSâ€™ CAN RESULT IN FALSE MEMORIES, WITH POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES FOR DOWNSTREAM BEHAVIOUR. GIVEN THE SHARP RISE IN ONLINE MISINFORMATION DURING THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC, IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THE FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE DEVELOPMENT OF FALSE MEMORIES. THE PRESENT STUDY MEASURED SUSCEPTIBILITY TO FALSE MEMORIES FOLLOWING EXPOSURE TO FABRICATED NEWS STORIES ABOUT THE PANDEMIC IN A SAMPLE OF 3746 PARTICIPANTS. WE INVESTIGATED THE EFFECT OF INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN (1) KNOWLEDGE ABOUT COVID-19, (2) ENGAGEMENT WITH MEDIA OR DISCUSSION ABOUT THE CORONAVIRUS, (3) ANXIETY ABOUT COVID-19 AND (4) ANALYTICAL REASONING. NOTABLY, OBJECTIVELY AND SUBJECTIVELY ASSESSED KNOWLEDGE ABOUT COVID-19 WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED. OBJECTIVELY ASSESSED KNOWLEDGE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH FEWER FALSE MEMORIES BUT MORE TRUE MEMORIES, SUGGESTING A TRUE DISCRIMINATION BETWEEN TRUE AND FAKE NEWS. IN CONTRAST, PARTICIPANTS WHO MERELY BELIEVED THEMSELVES TO BE VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE WERE MORE LIKELY TO REPORT A MEMORY FOR TRUE STORIES, BUT SHOWED NO REDUCTION IN FALSE MEMORIES. SIMILARLY, INDIVIDUALS WHO REPORTED HIGH LEVELS OF MEDIA ENGAGEMENT OR ANXIETY ABOUT COVID-19 REPORTED AN INCREASE IN TRUE (BUT NOT FALSE) MEMORIES. FINALLY, HIGHER LEVELS OF ANALYTICAL REASONING WERE ASSOCIATED WITH FEWER MEMORIES FOR BOTH TRUE AND FABRICATED STORIES, SUGGESTING A STRICTER THRESHOLD FOR REPORTING A MEMORY FOR ANY STORY. THESE DATA INDICATE THAT FALSE MEMORIES CAN FORM IN RESPONSE TO FAKE COVID-19 NEWS AND THAT SUSCEPTIBILITY TO THIS MISINFORMATION IS AFFECTED BY THE INDIVIDUALâ€™S KNOWLEDGE ABOUT AND INTERACTION WITH COVID-19 INFORMATION, AS WELL AS THEIR TENDENCY TO THINK CRITICALLY.

672,DIMENSIONS OF MISINFORMATION ABOUT THE HPV VACCINE ON INSTAGRAM: CONTENT AND NETWORK ANALYSIS OF SOCIAL MEDIA CHARACTERISTICS,"BACKGROUND: THE HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS (HPV) VACCINE IS A MAJOR ADVANCEMENT IN CANCER PREVENTION AND THIS PRIMARY PREVENTION TOOL HAS THE POTENTIAL TO REDUCE AND ELIMINATE HPV-ASSOCIATED CANCERS; HOWEVER, THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF VACCINES IN GENERAL AND THE HPV VACCINE SPECIFICALLY HAVE COME UNDER ATTACK, PARTICULARLY THROUGH THE SPREAD OF MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA. THE POPULAR SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM INSTAGRAM REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF EXPOSURE TO HEALTH (MIS)INFORMATION; 1 IN 3 US ADULTS USE INSTAGRAM. OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS ANALYSIS WAS TO CHARACTERIZE PRO- AND ANTI-HPV VACCINE NETWORKS ON INSTAGRAM, AND TO DESCRIBE MISINFORMATION WITHIN THE ANTI-HPV VACCINE NETWORK. METHODS: FROM APRIL 2018 TO DECEMBER 2018, WE COLLECTED PUBLICLY AVAILABLE ENGLISH-LANGUAGE INSTAGRAM POSTS CONTAINING HASHTAGS #HPV, #HPVVACCINE, OR #GARDASIL USING NETLYTIC SOFTWARE (N=16,607). WE RANDOMLY SELECTED 10% OF THE SAMPLE AND CONTENT ANALYZED RELEVANT POSTS (N=580) FOR TEXT, IMAGE, AND SOCIAL MEDIA FEATURES AS WELL AS HOLISTIC ATTRIBUTES (EG, SENTIMENTS, PERSONAL STORIES). AMONG ANTIVACCINE POSTS, WE ORGANIZED ELEMENTS OF MISINFORMATION WITHIN FOUR BROAD DIMENSIONS: 1) MISINFORMATION THEORETICAL DOMAINS, 2) VACCINE DEBATE TOPICS, 3) EVIDENCE BASE, AND 4) HEALTH BELIEFS. WE CONDUCTED UNIVARIATE, BIVARIATE, AND NETWORK ANALYSES ON THE SUBSAMPLE OF POSTS TO QUANTIFY THE ROLE AND POSITION OF INDIVIDUAL POSTS IN THE NETWORK. RESULTS: COMPARED TO PROVACCINE POSTS (324/580, 55.9%), ANTIVACCINE POSTS (256/580, 44.1%) WERE MORE LIKELY TO ORIGINATE FROM INDIVIDUALS (64.1% ANTIVACCINE VS 25.0% PROVACCINE; P<.001) AND INCLUDE PERSONAL NARRATIVES (37.1% VS 25.6%; P=.003). IN THE ANTIVACCINE NETWORK, CORE MISINFORMATION CHARACTERISTICS INCLUDED MENTIONING #GARDASIL, PURPORTING TO REVEAL A LIE (IE, CONCEALMENT), CONSPIRACY THEORIES, UNSUBSTANTIATED CLAIMS, AND RISK OF VACCINE INJURY. INFORMATION/RESOURCE POSTS CLUSTERED AROUND MISINFORMATION DOMAINS INCLUDING FALSIFICATION, NANOPUBLICATIONS, AND VACCINE-PREVENTABLE DISEASE, WHEREAS PERSONAL NARRATIVE POSTS CLUSTERED AROUND DIFFERENT DOMAINS OF MISINFORMATION, INCLUDING CONCEALMENT, INJURY, AND CONSPIRACY THEORIES. THE MOST LIKED POST (6634 LIKES) IN OUR FULL SUBSAMPLE WAS A POSITIVE PERSONAL NARRATIVE POST, CREATED BY A NON-HEALTH INDIVIDUAL; THE MOST LIKED POST (5604 LIKES) IN OUR ANTIVACCINE SUBSAMPLE WAS AN INFORMATIONAL POST CREATED BY A HEALTH INDIVIDUAL. CONCLUSIONS: IDENTIFYING CHARACTERISTICS OF MISINFORMATION RELATED TO HPV VACCINE ON SOCIAL MEDIA WILL INFORM TARGETED INTERVENTIONS (EG, NETWORK OPINION LEADERS) AND HELP SOW CORRECTIVE INFORMATION AND STORIES TAILORED TO DIFFERENT FALSEHOODS.

THIS PROLIFERATION OF INFORMATION MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR THE PUBLIC TO DISTINGUISH TRUSTWORTHY NEWS AND CREDIBLE INFORMATION FROM UNTRUSTWORTHY SITES AND NON-CREDIBLE SOURCES. THE PERILS OF AN INFODEMIC DEBUTED WITH THE OUTBREAK OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND BOTS (I.E., AUTOMATED ACCOUNTS CONTROLLED BY A SET OF ALGORITHMS) THAT ARE SUSPECTED OF SPREADING THE INFODEMIC. ALTHOUGH PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS REVEALED THAT BOTS PLAYED A CENTRAL ROLE IN SPREADING MISINFORMATION DURING MAJOR POLITICAL EVENTS, HOW BOTS BEHAVIOR DURING THE INFODEMIC IS UNCLEAR.

METHODS IN TOTAL, 440 STUDENTS TOOK PART AND WERE ASKED TO COMPLETE AN ONLINE SURVEY THAT INCLUDED QUESTIONS ON SOCIAL MEDIA TRUST, THE ""GENERAL HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE INDEX"" (GHQ-12), AND A SCALE MEASURING ""ATTITUDE TOWARDS VACCINATION"". RESULTS OUR DATA DEMONSTRATED A LOW FREQUENCY OF MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS AMONG LEBANESE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS, WHICH WAS CORRELATED TO FREQUENT SOCIAL MEDIA EXPOSURE DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. THESE FINDINGS SUGGESTED THAT STUDENTS ARE MORE AWARE OF MISINFORMATION AND HAD LOWER RATES OF DESPAIR AND ANXIETY THAN THE GENERAL POPULATION.

b-432,FACTORS INFLUENCING FAKE NEWS REBUTTAL ACCEPTANCE DURING THE COVID19 PANDEMIC AND THE MODERATING EFFECT OF COGNITIVE ABILITY,"FAKE NEWS IS SPREADING RAPIDLY ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND POSES A SERIOUS THREAT TO THE COVID-19 OUTBREAK RESPONSE. THIS STUDY THUS AIMS TO REVEAL THE FACTORS INFLUENCING THE ACCEPTANCE OF FAKE NEWS REBUTTALS ON SINA WEIBO. DRAWING ON THE ELABORATION LIKELIHOOD MODEL (ELM), WE USED TEXT MINING AND THE ECONOMETRICS METHOD TO INVESTIGATE THE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG THE CENTRAL ROUTE (REBUTTAL'S INFORMATION READABILITY AND ARGUMENT QUALITY), PERIPHERAL ROUTE (REBUTTAL'S SOURCE CREDIBILITY, INCLUDING AUTHORITY AND INFLUENCE), AND REBUTTAL ACCEPTANCE, AS WELL AS THE MODERATING EFFECT OF RECEIVER'S COGNITIVE ABILITY ON THESE RELATIONSHIPS. OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT SOURCE AUTHORITY HAD A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON REBUTTAL ACCEPTANCE, WHILE SOURCE INFLUENCE HAD A POSITIVE EFFECT. SECOND, BOTH INFORMATION READABILITY AND ARGUMENT QUALITY HAD POSITIVE EFFECTS ON REBUTTAL ACCEPTANCE. IN ADDITION, INDIVIDUALS WITH LOW COGNITIVE ABILITIES RELIED MORE ON SOURCE CREDIBILITY AND ARGUMENT QUALITY TO ACCEPT REBUTTALS, WHILE INDIVIDUALS WITH HIGH COGNITIVE ABILITIES RELIED MORE ON INFORMATION READABILITY. THIS STUDY CAN PROVIDE DECISION SUPPORT FOR PRACTITIONERS TO ESTABLISH MORE EFFECTIVE FAKE NEWS REBUTTAL STRATEGIES; IT IS ESPECIALLY VALUABLE TO REDUCE THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF FAKE NEWS RELATED TO MAJOR PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES AND SAFEGUARD THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ANTI-EPIDEMIC STRATEGIES.",COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR,NA,2022,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2021.107174,7,"6,8",1,0,0,CHINA,COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR

BY ASSIGNING THE TWITTER USERS AN UNTRUSTWORTHINESS (U) SCORE BASED ON HOW FREQUENTLY THEY ENGAGE WITH UNRELIABLE MEDIA OUTLETS AND CROSS-CHECKING IT WITH A QUALITATIVE POLITICAL ANNOTATION OF THE COMMUNITIES, WE SHOW THAT SUCH INFORMATION CONSUMPTION IS NOT EQUALLY DISTRIBUTED ACROSS THE TWITTER USERS. INDEED, WE IDENTIFY CLUSTERS CHARACTERISED BY A VERY HIGH PRESENCE OF ACCOUNTS THAT FREQUENTLY SHARE CONTENT FROM LESS RELIABLE NEWS SOURCES. THE USERS WITH HIGH U ARE MORE KEEN TO INTERACT WITH BOT-LIKE ACCOUNTS THAT TEND TO INJECT MORE UNRELIABLE CONTENT INTO THE NETWORK AND TO RETWEET THAT CONTENT. THUS, OUR METHODOLOGY APPLIED TO THIS REAL-WORLD NETWORK PROVIDES EVIDENCE, IN AN EASY AND STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY, THAT THERE IS STRONG INTERPLAY BETWEEN ACCOUNTS THAT DISPLAY HIGHER BOT-LIKE ACTIVITY AND USERS MORE FOCUSED ON NEWS FROM UNRELIABLE SOURCES AND THAT THIS INFLUENCES THE DIFFUSION OF THIS INFORMATION ACROSS THE NETWORK.

b-1535,PREVALENCE OF ANGER ENGAGED IN SADNESS ENGAGEMENT IN MISINFORMATION CORRECTION AND EMOTIONAL TWEETS DURING MASS SHOOTINGS,"PURPOSE: THE GOAL OF THIS STUDY IS TO EXAMINE HOW TWEETS CONTAINING DISTINCT EMOTIONS (I.E., EMOTIONAL TWEETS) AND DIFFERENT INFORMATION TYPES (I.E., MISINFORMATION, CORRECTIVE INFORMATION, AND OTHERS) ARE PREVALENT DURING THE INITIAL PHASE OF MASS SHOOTINGS AND FURTHERMORE, HOW USERS ENGAGE IN THOSE TWEETS. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: THE RESEARCHERS MANUALLY CODED 1,478 TWEETS POSTED BETWEEN AUGUST 3Ã¢â‚¬â€œ11, 2019, IN THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH OF THE EL PASO AND DAYTON MASS SHOOTINGS. THIS MANUAL CODING APPROACH SYSTEMATICALLY EXAMINED THE DISTINCT EMOTIONS AND INFORMATION TYPES OF EACH TWEET. FINDINGS: THE AUTHORS FOUND THAT, ON TWITTER, MISINFORMATION WAS MORE PREVALENT THAN CORRECTION DURING CRISES AND A LARGE PORTION OF MISINFORMATION HAD NEGATIVE EMOTIONS (I.E., ANGER, SADNESS, AND ANXIETY), WHILE CORRECTION FEATURED ANGER. NOTABLY, SADNESS-EXHIBITING TWEETS WERE MORE LIKELY TO BE RETWEETED AND LIKED BY USERS, BUT TWEETS CONTAINING OTHER EMOTIONS (I.E., ANGER, ANXIETY, AND JOY) WERE LESS LIKELY TO BE RETWEETED AND LIKED. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: ONLY A PORTION OF THE LARGER CONVERSATION WAS MANUALLY CODED. HOWEVER, THE CURRENT STUDY PROVIDES AN OVERALL PICTURE OF HOW TWEETS ARE CIRCULATED DURING CRISES IN TERMS OF MISINFORMATION AND CORRECTION, AND MOREOVER, HOW EMOTIONS AND INFORMATION TYPES ALIKE INFLUENCE ENGAGEMENT BEHAVIORS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: THE PERVASIVE ANGER-LADEN TWEETS ABOUT MASS SHOOTING INCIDENTS MIGHT CONTRIBUTE TO HOSTILE NARRATIVES AND EVENTUALLY REIGNITE POLITICAL POLARIZATION. THE NOTABLE PRESENCE OF ANGER IN CORRECTION TWEETS FURTHER SUGGESTS THAT THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO PROVIDE CORRECTION TO MISINFORMATION ALSO RELY ON EMOTION. MOREOVER, OUR STUDY SUGGESTS THAT DISPLAYS OF SADNESS COULD FUNCTION IN A WAY THAT LEADS INDIVIDUALS TO RELY ON FALSE CLAIMS AS A COPING STRATEGY TO COUNTERACT UNCERTAINTY.

EXPERTS HAVE SPECULATED THAT CONSUMING MISINFORMATION ONLINE CAN POTENTIALLY WORSEN THE MENTAL HEALTH OF INDIVIDUALS, BY CAUSING HEIGHTENED ANXIETY, STRESS, AND EVEN SUICIDAL IDEATION. THE PRESENT STUDY AIMS TO QUANTIFY THE CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SHARING MISINFORMATION, A STRONG INDICATOR OF CONSUMING MISINFORMATION, AND EXPERIENCING EXACERBATED ANXIETY. WE CONDUCT A LARGE-SCALE OBSERVATIONAL STUDY SPANNING OVER 80 MILLION TWITTER POSTS MADE BY 76,985 TWITTER USERS DURING AN 18.5 MONTH PERIOD. THE RESULTS FROM THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATE THAT USERS WHO SHARED COVID-19 MISINFORMATION EXPERIENCED APPROXIMATELY TWO TIMES ADDITIONAL INCREASE IN ANXIETY WHEN COMPARED TO SIMILAR USERS WHO DID NOT SHARE MISINFORMATION. SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS REVEALS THAT WOMEN, RACIAL MINORITIES, AND INDIVIDUALS WITH LOWER LEVELS OF EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES EXPERIENCED A DISPROPORTIONATELY HIGHER INCREASE IN ANXIETY WHEN COMPARED TO THE OTHER USERS.

CORRECTION IS A CRUCIAL COUNTERMEASURE TO DEBUNK MISPERCEPTIONS. HOWEVER, THE EFFECTIVE MECHANISM OF CORRECTION ON SOCIAL MEDIA IS NOT FULLY VERIFIED. PREVIOUS WORKS FOCUS ON PSYCHOLOGICAL THEORIES AND EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES, WHILE THE APPLICABILITY OF CONCLUSIONS TO THE ACTUAL SOCIAL MEDIA IS UNCLEAR. THIS STUDY EXPLORES DETERMINANTS GOVERNING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF MISINFORMATION CORRECTIONS ON SOCIAL MEDIA WITH A COMBINATION OF A DATA-DRIVEN APPROACH AND RELATED THEORIES ON PSYCHOLOGY AND COMMUNICATION. SPECIFICALLY, REFERRING TO THE BACKFIRE EFFECT, SOURCE CREDIBILITY, AND AUDIENCE'S ROLE IN DISSEMINATION THEORIES, WE PROPOSE FIVE HYPOTHESES CONTAINING SEVEN POTENTIAL FACTORS (REGARDING CORRECTION CONTENT AND PUBLISHERS' INFLUENCE), E.G., THE PROPORTION OF ORIGINAL MISINFORMATION AND WARNINGS OF MISINFORMATION. THEN, WE OBTAIN 1487 SIGNIFICANT COVID-19 RELATED CORRECTIONS ON MICROBLOG BETWEEN JANUARY 1ST, 2020 AND APRIL 30TH, 2020, AND CONDUCT ANNOTATIONS, WHICH CHARACTERIZE EACH PIECE OF CORRECTION BASED ON THE AFOREMENTIONED FACTORS. WE DEMONSTRATE SEVERAL PROMISING CONCLUSIONS THROUGH A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF THE DATASET. FOR EXAMPLE, MENTIONING EXCESSIVE ORIGINAL MISINFORMATION IN CORRECTIONS WOULD NOT UNDERMINE PEOPLE'S BELIEVABILITY WITHIN A SHORT PERIOD AFTER READING; WARNINGS OF MISINFORMATION IN A DEMANDING TONE MAKE CORRECTION WORSE; DETERMINANTS OF CORRECTION EFFECTIVENESS VARY AMONG DIFFERENT TOPICS OF MISINFORMATION.

A TOTAL OF 24 PARTICIPANTS (N-FEMALE = 14, N-MALE = 10) TOOK PART IN SEMISTRUCTURED TELEPHONE INTERVIEWS FROM MARCH TO JUNE 2020. THEMATIC ANALYSIS WAS GUIDED BY PRINCIPLES OF SOCIAL CONSTRUCTIONISM. A TOTAL OF 3 THEMES WERE DEVELOPED FROM THE DATA. FIRST, PARTICIPANT INTERACTIONS WITH INFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA WERE DIRECTED BY THE INTENTION ""STAYING SOCIAL."" SECOND, THE ROLE OF SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE PANDEMIC WAS FRAMED AS ""A PERFECT STORM FOR FAKE NEWS."" THIRD, PARTICIPANTS FRAMED INTERACTIONS IN TERMS OF ""FACT-CHECKING"" WITH DIFFERING RIGOR IN THIS PROCESS. THE DATA DEMONSTRATED THE COMPLEXITIES INVOLVED WHEN IT CAME TO PARTICIPANTS' EXPERIENCES RELATED TO FAKE NEWS AND MISINFORMATION SURROUNDING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. THE RESULTS ALSO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE KEY CHALLENGES FACED WHEN IT COMES TO PREVENTING THE SPREAD OF FAKE NEWS AND MISINFORMATION, PARTICULARLY FROM THE ONLINE TO THE OFFLINE ENVIRONMENT.

WE ACCOMPLISH THIS THROUGH A THEMATIC ANALYSIS OF DOCUMENTS PUBLISHED BY THE THREE PLATFORMS THAT ADDRESS FACT-CHECKING, PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT FOCUS ON COVID-19. IN ADDITION TO EXAMINING WHAT THE PLATFORMS SAID THEY DID, WE ALSO EXAMINED WHAT THE PLATFORMS ACTUALLY DID IN PRACTICE VIA A RETROSPECTIVE CASE STUDY DRAWING ON SECONDARY DATA ABOUT THE VIRAL CONSPIRACY VIDEO, PLANDEMIC. WE DEMONSTRATE THAT THE PLATFORMS FOCUSED THEIR ENERGIES PRIMARILY ON THE VISIBILITY OF COVID-19 MIS/DISINFORMATION ON THEIR SITES VIA (OFTEN VAGUELY DESCRIBED) POLICIES AND PRACTICES RIFE WITH SUBJECTIVITY. MOREOVER, THE PLATFORMS COMMUNICATED THE EXPECTATION THAT USERS SHOULD ULTIMATELY BE THE ONES TO HASH OUT WHAT THEY BELIEVE IS TRUE. WE ARGUE THAT THIS APPROACH DOES NOT NECESSARILY SERVE THE GOAL OF ENSURING A WELL-INFORMED PUBLIC, AS HAS BEEN THE GOAL OF FACT-CHECKING HISTORICALLY, AND DOES LITTLE TO ADDRESS THE UNDERLYING CONDITIONS AND STRUCTURES THAT PERMIT THE CIRCULATION AND AMPLIFICATION OF FALSE INFORMATION ONLINE.",SOCIAL MEDIA + SOCIETY,NA,2022,https://doi.org/10.1177/20563051211069048,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,USA,SOCIAL MEDIA + SOCIETY

b-464,RESHAPING ONLINE NARRATIVES WHEN BOTS PROMOTE THE MESSAGE OF PRESIDENT TRUMP DURING HIS FIRST IMPEACHMENT,"INFLUENCING AND FRAMING DEBATES ON TWITTER PROVIDES POWER TO SHAPE PUBLIC OPINION. BOTS HAVE BECOME ESSENTIAL TOOLS OF 'COMPUTATIONAL PROPAGANDA' ON SOCIAL MEDIA SUCH AS TWITTER, OFTEN CONTRIBUTING TO A LARGE FRACTION OF THE TWEETS REGARDING POLITICAL EVENTS SUCH AS ELECTIONS. ALTHOUGH ANALYSES HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED REGARDING THE FIRST IMPEACHMENT OF FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, THEY HAVE BEEN FOCUSED ON EITHER A MANUAL EXAMINATION OF RELATIVELY FEW TWEETS TO EMPHASIZE RHETORIC, OR THE USE OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) OF A MUCH LARGER CORPUS WITH RESPECT TO COMMON METRICS SUCH AS SENTIMENT. IN THIS PAPER, WE COMPLEMENT EXISTING ANALYSES BY EXAMINING THE ROLE OF BOTS IN THE FIRST IMPEACHMENT WITH RESPECT TO THREE QUESTIONS AS FOLLOWS. (Q1) ARE BOTS ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN THE DEBATE? (Q2) DO BOTS TARGET ONE POLITICAL AFFILIATION MORE THAN ANOTHER? (Q3) WHICH SOURCES ARE USED BY BOTS TO SUPPORT THEIR ARGUMENTS? OUR METHODS START WITH COLLECTING OVER 13M TWEETS ON SIX KEY DATES, FROM OCTOBER 6TH 2019 TO JANUARY 21ST 2020. WE USED MACHINE LEARNING TO EVALUATE THE SENTIMENT OF THE TWEETS (VIA BERT) AND WHETHER IT ORIGINATES FROM A BOT. WE THEN EXAMINED THESE SENTIMENTS WITH RESPECT TO A BALANCED SAMPLE OF DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS DIRECTLY RELEVANT TO THE IMPEACHMENT, SUCH AS HOUSE SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI, SENATOR MITCH MCCONNELL, AND (THEN FORMER VICE PRESIDENT) JOE BIDEN. THE CONTENT OF POSTS FROM BOTS WAS FURTHER ANALYZED WITH RESPECT TO THE SOURCES USED (WITH BIAS RATINGS FROM ALLSIDES AND AD FONTES) AND THEMES. OUR FIRST FINDING IS THAT BOTS HAVE PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN CONTRIBUTING TO THE OVERALL NEGATIVE TONE OF THE DEBATE (Q1). BOTS WERE TARGETING DEMOCRATS MORE THAN REPUBLICANS (Q2), AS EVIDENCED BOTH BY A DIFFERENCE IN RATIO (BOTS HAD MORE NEGATIVE -TO-POSITIVE TWEETS ON DEMOCRATS THAN REPUBLICANS) AND IN COMPOSITION (USE OF DEROGATORY NICKNAMES). FINALLY, THE SOURCES PROVIDED BY BOTS WERE ALMOST TWICE AS LIKELY TO BE FROM THE RIGHT THAN THE LEFT, WITH A NOTICEABLE USE OF HYPER-PARTISAN RIGHT AND MOST EXTREME RIGHT SOURCES (Q3). BOTS WERE THUS PURPOSELY USED TO PROMOTE A MISLEADING VERSION OF EVENTS. OVERALL, THIS SUGGESTS AN INTENTIONAL USE OF BOTS AS PART OF A STRATEGY, THUS PROVIDING FURTHER CONFIRMATION THAT COMPUTATIONAL PROPAGANDA IS INVOLVED IN DEFINING POLITICAL EVENTS IN THE UNITED STATES. AS ANY EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS, OUR WORK HAS SEVERAL LIMITATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, TRUMP'S RHETORIC ON TWITTER HAS PREVIOUSLY BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY AN OVERLY NEGATIVE TONE, THUS TWEETS DETECTED AS NEGATIVE MAY BE ECHOING HIS MESSAGE RATHER THAN ACTING AGAINST HIM. PREVIOUS WORKS SHOW THAT THIS POSSIBILITY IS LIMITED, AND ITS EXISTENCE WOULD ONLY STRENGTHEN OUR CONCLUSIONS. AS OUR ANALYSIS IS BASED ON NLP, WE FOCUS ON PROCESSING A LARGE VOLUME OF TWEETS RATHER THAN MANUALLY READING ALL OF THEM, THUS FUTURE STUDIES MAY COMPLEMENT OUR APPROACH BY USING QUALITATIVE METHODS TO ASSESS THE SPECIFIC ARGUMENTS USED BY BOTS.",PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE,NA,2022,https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.947,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,USA,PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE

WE MEASURED PARTICIPANTS' ABILITY TO IDENTIFY WHETHER INFORMATION WAS SCIENTIFICALLY VALID OR INVALID. ANALYSIS OF PARTICIPANTS' SEARCH STYLE REVEALS THAT BOTH MONETARY INCENTIVES AND POP-UP INCREASED THE USE OF FACT-CHECKING STRATEGIES. MONETARY INCENTIVES WERE OVERALL EFFECTIVE IN INCREASING ACCURACY, WHEREAS THE POP-UP WORKED WHEN THE SOURCE OF INFORMATION WAS UNKNOWN. POP-UP AND INCENTIVES, WHEN USED TOGETHER, PRODUCED A CUMULATIVE EFFECT ON ACCURACY.

b-557,THE CHALLENGE OF DEBUNKING HEALTH MISINFORMATION IN DYNAMIC SOCIAL MEDIA CONVERSATIONS ONLINE RANDOMIZED STUDY OF PUBLIC MASKING DURING COVID19,"BACKGROUND: THE SPREAD OF FALSE AND MISLEADING HEALTH INFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA CAN CAUSE INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIAL HARM. RESEARCH ON DEBUNKING HAS SHOWN THAT PROPERLY DESIGNED CORRECTIONS CAN MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF MISINFORMATION, BUT LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE IMPACT OF CORRECTION IN THE CONTEXT OF PROLONGED SOCIAL MEDIA DEBATES. FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN A SOCIAL MEDIA USER TAKES TO FACEBOOK TO MAKE A FALSE CLAIM ABOUT A HEALTH-RELATED PRACTICE AND A HEALTH EXPERT SUBSEQUENTLY REFUTES THE CLAIM, THE CONVERSATION RARELY ENDS THERE. OFTEN, THE SOCIAL MEDIA USER PROCEEDS BY REBUKING THE CRITIC AND DOUBLING DOWN ON THE CLAIM. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF SUCH EXTENDED BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN FALSE CLAIMS AND DEBUNKING ATTEMPTS ON OBSERVERS' DISPOSITIONS TOWARD BEHAVIOR THAT SCIENCE FAVORS. WE TESTED COMPETING PREDICTIONS ABOUT THE EFFECT OF EXTENDED EXPOSURE ON PEOPLE'S ATTITUDES AND INTENTIONS TOWARD MASKING IN PUBLIC DURING THE EARLY DAYS OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND EXPLORED SEVERAL PSYCHOLOGICAL PROCESSES POTENTIALLY UNDERLYING THIS EFFECT. METHODS: A TOTAL OF 500 US RESIDENTS TOOK PART IN AN ONLINE EXPERIMENT IN OCTOBER 2020. THEY REPORTED ON THEIR ATTITUDES AND INTENTIONS TOWARD WEARING MASKS IN PUBLIC. THEY WERE THEN RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO ONE OF FOUR SOCIAL MEDIA EXPOSURE CONDITIONS (MISINFORMATION ONLY VS MISINFORMATION+CORRECTION VS MISINFORMATION+CORRECTION+REBUKE VS MISINFORMATION+CORRECTION+REBUKE+SECOND CORRECTION), AND REPORTED THEIR ATTITUDES AND INTENTIONS FOR A SECOND TIME. THEY ALSO INDICATED WHETHER THEY WOULD CONSIDER SHARING THE THREAD IF THEY WERE TO SEE IT ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND ANSWERED QUESTIONS ON POTENTIAL MEDIATORS AND COVARIATES. RESULTS: EXPOSURE TO MISINFORMATION HAD A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON ATTITUDES AND INTENTIONS TOWARD MASKING (BETA=-.35, 95% CI -.42 TO -.29; P<.001). MOREOVER, INITIAL DEBUNKING OF A FALSE CLAIM GENERALLY IMPROVED ATTITUDES AND INTENTIONS TOWARD MASKING (BETA=.35, 95% CI .16 TO .54; P<.001). HOWEVER, THIS IMPROVEMENT WAS WASHED OUT BY FURTHER EXPOSURE TO FALSE CLAIMS AND DEBUNKING ATTEMPTS (BETA=-.53, 95% CI -.72 TO -.34; P<.001). THE LATTER RESULT IS PARTIALLY EXPLAINED BY A DECREASE IN THE PERCEIVED OBJECTIVITY OF TRUTH. THAT IS, EXTENDED EXPOSURE TO FALSE CLAIMS AND DEBUNKING ATTEMPTS APPEAR TO WEAKEN THE BELIEF THAT THERE IS AN OBJECTIVELY CORRECT ANSWER TO HOW PEOPLE OUGHT TO BEHAVE IN THIS SITUATION, WHICH IN TURN LEADS TO LESS POSITIVE REACTIONS TOWARD MASKING AS THE PRESCRIBED BEHAVIOR. CONCLUSIONS: HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND SCIENCE ADVOCATES FACE AN UNDERAPPRECIATED CHALLENGE IN ATTEMPTING TO DEBUNK MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA. ALTHOUGH ENGAGING IN EXTENDED DEBATES WITH SCIENCE DENIERS AND OTHER PURVEYORS OF BUNK APPEARS NECESSARY, MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO ADDRESS THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH ENGAGEMENT.",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,NA,2022,https://doi.org/10.2196/34831,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,CANADA,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
b-598,THE IMPORTANCE OF SOCIAL MEDIA USERS RESPONSES IN TACKLING DIGITAL COVID19 MISINFORMATION IN AFRICA,"OBJECTIVE DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES PRESENT BOTH AN OPPORTUNITY AND A THREAT FOR ADVANCING PUBLIC HEALTH. AT A TIME OF PANDEMIC, SOCIAL MEDIA HAS BECOME A TOOL FOR THE RAPID SPREAD OF MISINFORMATION. MITIGATING THE IMPACTS OF MISINFORMATION IS PARTICULARLY ACUTE ACROSS AFRICA, WHERE WHATSAPP AND OTHER FORMS OF SOCIAL MEDIA DOMINATE, AND WHERE THE DUAL THREATS OF MISINFORMATION AND COVID-19 THREATEN LIVES AND LIVELIHOODS. GIVEN THE SCALE OF THE PROBLEM WITHIN AFRICA, WE SET OUT TO UNDERSTAND (I) THE POTENTIAL HARM THAT MISINFORMATION CAUSES, (II) THE AVAILABLE EVIDENCE ON HOW TO MITIGATE THAT MISINFORMATION AND (III) HOW USER RESPONSES TO MISINFORMATION SHAPE THE POTENTIAL FOR THOSE MITIGATING STRATEGIES TO REDUCE THE RISK OF HARM. METHODS WE UNDERTOOK A MULTI-METHOD STUDY, COMBINING A RAPID REVIEW OF THE RESEARCH EVIDENCE WITH A SURVEY OF WHATSAPP USERS ACROSS AFRICA. RESULTS WE IDENTIFIED 87 STUDIES FOR INCLUSION IN OUR REVIEW AND HAD 286 SURVEY RESPONDENTS FROM 17 AFRICAN COUNTRIES. OUR FINDINGS SHOW THE CONSIDERABLE HARMS CAUSED BY PUBLIC HEALTH MISINFORMATION IN AFRICA AND THE LACK OF EVIDENCE FOR OR AGAINST STRATEGIES TO MITIGATE AGAINST SUCH HARMS. FURTHERMORE, THEY HIGHLIGHT HOW SOCIAL MEDIA USERS' RESPONSES TO PUBLIC HEALTH MISINFORMATION CAN MITIGATE AND EXACERBATE POTENTIAL HARMS. UNDERSTANDING THE WAYS IN WHICH SOCIAL MEDIA USERS RESPOND TO MISINFORMATION SHEDS LIGHT ON POTENTIAL MITIGATION STRATEGIES. CONCLUSIONS PUBLIC HEALTH PRACTITIONERS WHO UTILISE DIGITAL HEALTH APPROACHES MUST NOT UNDERESTIMATE THE IMPORTANCE OF CONSIDERING THE ROLE OF SOCIAL MEDIA IN THE CIRCULATION OF MISINFORMATION, NOR OF THE RESPONSES OF SOCIAL MEDIA USERS IN SHAPING ATTEMPTS TO MITIGATE AGAINST THE HARMS OF SUCH MISINFORMATION.",DIGITAL HEALTH,NA,2022,https://doi.org/10.1177/20552076221085070,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,UNITED KINGDOM,DIGITAL HEALTH

THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF MISINFORMATION AND SOCIAL NOISE ON THE ORIGINAL INTENDED MESSAGE OF BLM USING DATA FROM THE TWITTER HASHTAG 'BLM'. RESULTS FROM TOPIC MODELLING HAVE SHOWN THE STRONG PRESENCE OF MISINFORMATION AND SOCIAL NOISE. SUCH INFORMATION WAS MOST PROBABLY INTENDED TO INFLUENCE, MISLEAD AND DILUTE THE ORIGINAL INTENDED MESSAGE. HOWEVER, DESPITE THE EFFORT TO DISTORT THE ORIGINAL MESSAGE OF BLM, RESULTS FROM SENTIMENT ANALYSIS SHOW THAT USERS' OPINIONS OF THE BLM MOVEMENT REMAINED POSITIVE.",JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE,NA,2022,https://doi.org/10.1177/01655515221077347,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,USA,JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE
b-613,TIKTOK AND ATTENTIONDEFICITHYPERACTIVITY DISORDER A CROSSSECTIONAL STUDY OF SOCIAL MEDIA CONTENT QUALITY,"OBJECTIVES SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS ARE INCREASINGLY BEING USED TO DISSEMINATE MENTAL HEALTH INFORMATION ONLINE. USER-GENERATED CONTENT ABOUT ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER (ADHD) IS ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR HEALTH TOPICS ON THE VIDEO-SHARING SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM TIKTOK. WE SOUGHT TO INVESTIGATE THE QUALITY OF TIKTOK VIDEOS ABOUT ADHD. METHOD THE TOP 100 MOST POPULAR VIDEOS ABOUT ADHD UPLOADED BY TIKTOK VIDEO CREATORS WERE CLASSIFIED AS MISLEADING, USEFUL, OR PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. DESCRIPTIVE AND QUANTITATIVE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE VIDEOS WERE OBTAINED. THE PATIENT EDUCATION MATERIALS ASSESSMENT TOOL FOR AUDIOVISUAL MATERIALS (PEMAT-A/V) AND JOURNAL OF AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION (JAMA) BENCHMARK CRITERIA WERE USED TO ASSESS THE OVERALL QUALITY, UNDERSTANDABILITY, AND ACTIONABILITY OF THE VIDEOS. RESULTS OF THE 100 VIDEOS MEETING INCLUSION CRITERIA, 52% (N = 52) WERE CLASSIFIED AS MISLEADING, 27% (N = 27) AS PERSONAL EXPERIENCE, AND 21% (N = 21) AS USEFUL. CLASSIFICATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN CLINICIAN RATINGS WAS 86% (KAPPA STATISTIC OF 0.7766). VIDEOS ON THE PLATFORM WERE HIGHLY UNDERSTANDABLE BY VIEWERS BUT HAD LOW ACTIONABILITY. NON-HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS UPLOADED THE MAJORITY OF MISLEADING VIDEOS. HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS UPLOADED HIGHER QUALITY AND MORE USEFUL VIDEOS, COMPARED TO NON-HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. CONCLUSIONS APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THE ANALYZED TIKTOK VIDEOS ABOUT ADHD WERE MISLEADING.

METHODS: WE QUERIED YOUTUBEÃ¢â€žÂ¢ WITH TERMS RELATED TO PLACENTA ACCRETA. PATIENT EDUCATION MATERIALS ASSESSMENT TOOL FOR AUDIO-VISUAL CONTENT (PEMAT A/V), GLOBAL QUALITY SCORE (GQS), DISCERN SCORE AND MISINFORMATION TOOL WERE USED TO ASSESS VIDEOSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ QUALITY CONTENT. RESULTS: SIXTY-FOUR VIDEOS WERE SUITABLE FOR THE ANALYSES. OF THOSE, 42 (65.6%) AND 22 (34.4%) WERE PRODUCES BY HEALTHCARE WORKS AND OTHERS, RESPECTIVELY. THE MEDIAN PEMAT A/V UNDERSTANDABILITY AND ACTIONABILITY SCORE WAS 75 AND 66.7%, RESPECTIVELY. ACCORDING TO GQS, 31.2 AND 45.3% VIDEOS WERE EXCELLENT OR GOOD AND GENERALLY POOR OR POOR, RESPECTIVELY. THE MEDIAN DISCERN SCORE OF SECTION 1 WAS 27 (OUT OF 40), OF SECTION 2 WAS 16 (OUT OF 35) AND OF SECTION 3 WAS 2 (OUT OF 5). ACCORDING TO MISINFORMATION TOOL, THE WORST DESCRIBED ASPECT WAS THE ONE REGARDING THE POSSIBLE RISK FACTOR ASSOCIATED TO PLACENTA ACCRETA. PERFORMING THE QUALITY ASSESSMENT ACCORDING TO VIDEO AUTHORING ENTITY, VIDEOS PRODUCED BY HEALTHCARE WORKERS HARBORED A HIGHER QUALITY CONTENT, RELATIVE TO THE OTHERS. CONCLUSIONS: CURRENTLY, THE OVERALL CONSIDERATION OF YOUTUBEÃ¢â€žÂ¢ VIDEO CONTENT ON PLACENTA ACCRETA IS LOW.

b-1492,ANALYZING COVID19 DISINFORMATION ON TWITTER USING THE HASHTAGS SCAMDEMIC AND PLANDEMIC RETROSPECTIVE STUDY,"INTRODUCTION THE USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS LED TO AN ""INFODEMIC"" OF MIS- AND DISINFORMATION WITH POTENTIALLY GRAVE CONSEQUENCES. TO EXPLORE MEANS OF COUNTERACTING DISINFORMATION, WE ANALYZED TWEETS CONTAINING THE HASHTAGS #SCAMDEMIC AND #PLANDEMIC. METHODS USING A TWITTER SCRAPING TOOL CALLED TWINT, WE COLLECTED 419,269 ENGLISH-LANGUAGE TWEETS THAT CONTAINED Ã¢â‚¬Å“#SCAMDEMICÃ¢â‚¬Â OR Ã¢â‚¬Å“#PLANDEMICÃ¢â‚¬Â POSTED IN 2020. USING THE TWITTER APPLICATION-PROGRAMMING INTERFACE, WE EXTRACTED THE SAME TWEETS (BY TWEET ID) WITH ADDITIONAL USER METADATA. WE EXPLORED DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS OF TWEETS INCLUDING THEIR CONTENT AND USER PROFILES, ANALYZED SENTIMENTS AND EMOTIONS, PERFORMED TOPIC MODELING, AND DETERMINED TWEET AVAILABILITY IN BOTH DATASETS. RESULTS AFTER REMOVAL OF RETWEETS, REPLIES, NON-ENGLISH TWEETS, OR DUPLICATE TWEETS, 40,081 USERS TWEETED 227,067 TIMES USING OUR SELECTED HASHTAGS. THE MEAN WEEKLY SENTIMENT WAS OVERALL NEGATIVE FOR BOTH HASHTAGS. ONE IN FIVE USERS WHO USED THESE HASHTAGS WERE SUSPENDED BY TWITTER BY JANUARY 2021. SUSPENDED ACCOUNTS HAD AN AVERAGE OF 610 FOLLOWERS AND AN AVERAGE OF 6.7 TWEETS PER USER, WHILE ACTIVE USERS HAD AN AVERAGE OF 472 FOLLOWERS AND AN AVERAGE OF 5.4 TWEETS PER USER. THE MOST FREQUENT TWEET TOPIC WAS Ã¢â‚¬Å“COMPLAINTS AGAINST MANDATES INTRODUCED DURING THE PANDEMICÃ¢â‚¬Â (79,670 TWEETS), WHICH INCLUDED COMPLAINTS AGAINST MASKS, SOCIAL DISTANCING, AND CLOSURES. DISCUSSION WHILE SOCIAL MEDIA HAS DEMOCRATIZED SPEECH, IT ALSO PERMITS USERS TO DISSEMINATE POTENTIALLY UNVERIFIED OR MISLEADING INFORMATION THAT ENDANGERS PEOPLEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S LIVES AND PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTIONS. CHARACTERIZING TWEETS AND USERS THAT USE HASHTAGS ASSOCIATED WITH COVID-19 PANDEMIC DENIAL ALLOWED US TO UNDERSTAND THE EXTENT OF MISINFORMATION. WITH THE PREPONDERANCE OF INACCESSIBLE ORIGINAL TWEETS, WE CONCLUDED THAT POSTERS WERE IN DENIAL OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND SOUGHT TO DISPERSE RELATED MIS- OR DISINFORMATION RESULTING IN SUSPENSION. CONCLUSION LEVERAGING 227,067 TWEETS WITH THE HASHTAGS #SCAMDEMIC AND #PLANDEMIC IN 2020, WE WERE ABLE TO ELUCIDATE IMPORTANT TRENDS IN PUBLIC DISINFORMATION ABOUT THE COVID-19 VACCINE.

b-1503,CHARTING THE INFORMATION AND MISINFORMATION LANDSCAPE TO CHARACTERIZE MISINFODEMICS ON SOCIAL MEDIA COVID19 INFODEMIOLOGY STUDY AT A PLANETARY SCALE,"BACKGROUND: THE NOVEL CORONAVIRUS, ALSO KNOWN AS SARS-COV-2, HAS COME TO DEFINE MUCH OF OUR LIVES SINCE THE BEGINNING OF 2020. DURING THIS TIME, COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD IMPOSED LOCKDOWNS AND SOCIAL DISTANCING MEASURES. THE PHYSICAL MOVEMENTS OF PEOPLE GROUND TO A HALT, WHILE THEIR ONLINE INTERACTIONS INCREASED AS THEY TURNED TO ENGAGING WITH EACH OTHER VIRTUALLY. AS THE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION SHIFTED ONLINE, INFORMATION CONSUMPTION ALSO SHIFTED ONLINE. GOVERNING AUTHORITIES AND HEALTH AGENCIES HAVE INTENTIONALLY SHIFTED THEIR FOCUS TO USE SOCIAL MEDIA AND ONLINE PLATFORMS TO SPREAD FACTUAL AND TIMELY INFORMATION. HOWEVER, THIS HAS ALSO OPENED THE GATE FOR MISINFORMATION, CONTRIBUTING TO AND ACCELERATING THE PHENOMENON OF MISINFODEMICS. OBJECTIVE: WE CARRIED OUT AN ANALYSIS OF TWITTER DISCOURSE ON OVER 1 BILLION TWEETS RELATED TO COVID-19 OVER A YEAR TO IDENTIFY AND INVESTIGATE PREVALENT MISINFORMATION NARRATIVES AND TRENDS. WE ALSO AIMED TO DESCRIBE THE TWITTER AUDIENCE THAT IS MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO HEALTH-RELATED MISINFORMATION AND THE NETWORK MECHANISMS DRIVING MISINFODEMICS. METHODS: WE LEVERAGED A DATA SET THAT WE COLLECTED AND MADE PUBLIC, WHICH CONTAINED OVER 1 BILLION TWEETS RELATED TO COVID-19 BETWEEN JANUARY 2020 AND APRIL 2021. WE CREATED A SUBSET OF THIS LARGER DATA SET BY ISOLATING TWEETS THAT INCLUDED URLS WITH DOMAINS THAT HAD BEEN IDENTIFIED BY MEDIA BIAS/FACT CHECK AS BEING PRONE TO QUESTIONABLE AND MISINFORMATION CONTENT. BY LEVERAGING CLUSTERING AND TOPIC MODELING TECHNIQUES, WE IDENTIFIED MAJOR NARRATIVES, INCLUDING HEALTH MISINFORMATION AND CONSPIRACIES, WHICH WERE PRESENT WITHIN THIS SUBSET OF TWEETS. RESULTS: OUR FOCUS WAS ON A SUBSET OF 12,689,165 TWEETS THAT WE DETERMINED WERE REPRESENTATIVE OF COVID-19 MISINFORMATION NARRATIVES IN OUR FULL DATA SET. WHEN ANALYZING TWEETS THAT SHARED CONTENT FROM DOMAINS KNOWN TO BE QUESTIONABLE OR THAT PROMOTED MISINFORMATION, WE FOUND THAT A FEW KEY MISINFORMATION NARRATIVES EMERGED ABOUT HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINES, US OFFICIALS AND GOVERNING AGENCIES, AND COVID-19 PREVENTION MEASURES. WE FURTHER ANALYZED THE MISINFORMATION RETWEET NETWORK AND FOUND THAT USERS WHO SHARED BOTH QUESTIONABLE AND CONSPIRACY-RELATED CONTENT WERE CLUSTERED MORE CLOSELY IN THE NETWORK THAN OTHERS, SUPPORTING THE HYPOTHESIS THAT ECHO CHAMBERS CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE SPREAD OF HEALTH MISINFODEMICS. CONCLUSIONS: WE PRESENTED A SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS OF THE MAJOR MISINFORMATION DISCOURSE SURROUNDING COVID-19 AND THOSE WHO PROMOTED AND ENGAGED WITH IT. WHILE MISINFORMATION IS NOT LIMITED TO SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS, WE HOPE THAT OUR INSIGHTS, PARTICULARLY PERTAINING TO HEALTH-RELATED EMERGENCIES, WILL HELP PAVE THE WAY FOR COMPUTATIONAL INFODEMIOLOGY TO INFORM HEALTH SURVEILLANCE AND INTERVENTIONS.

THIS STUDY IS MOTIVATED BY THE NEED TO ASSESS THE SPREAD OF FAKE NEWS ON COVID-19 AMONGST SOCIAL MEDIA USERS IN KANO STATE. THE STUDY ADOPTED THE TECHNOLOGICAL DETERMINISM THEORY. IT SOUGHT TO INVESTIGATE THE EXTENT TO WHICH SOCIAL MEDIA USERS IN KANO STATE ARE AWARE OF FAKE NEWS ON COVID-19, TO FIND KEY AREAS OF COVID-19 ON WHICH FAKE NEWS WAS SPREAD ON SOCIAL MEDIA IN KANO STATE, TO FIND OUT THE FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE SPREAD OF FAKE NEWS ON COVID-19 AMONG SOCIAL MEDIA USERS IN KANO STATE AS WELL AS TO EXAMINE THE CONSEQUENCE OF THE SPREAD OF FAKE NEWS ON COVID-19 AMONG SOCIAL MEDIA USERS IN KANO STATE. A QUANTITATIVE APPROACH WAS ADOPTED THROUGH THE ADMINISTRATION OF 395 QUESTIONNAIRES TO THE RESPONDENTS. THE STUDY FOUND THAT 65.6% OF THE RESPONDENTS ARE AWARE OF FAKE NEWS ON COVID-19 IN KANO STATE, 41.3% OF THE RESPONDENTS AGREED THAT INFLATED NUMBER WAS A MAJOR TOPIC/KEY AREA BEING DISCUSSED, 30.1% OF THE RESPONDENTS SAID TRENDING TOPICS ON COVID-19 INFLUENCED THE SPREADING OF FAKE NEWS ON THE TOPIC AND 41.8% OF THE RESPONDENTS ARE OF THE VIEW THAT THE CONSEQUENCE OF THE SPREAD OF COVID-19 FAKE NEWS IS NON-ADHERENCE TO SAFETY MEASURES. HENCE 74.2% OF THE RESPONDENTS AGREED THAT SOCIAL MEDIA AIDS THE SPREAD OF FAKE NEWS ON COVID-19.

AFTER MONTHS OF LOCKDOWNS, MASS VACCINATION WAS A SILVER LINING MOMENT, BUT IT WAS UNDER THREAT FROM DISINFORMATION BOOSTED BY MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA. THIS RESEARCH EXPLORES HOW OPINION LEADERS AMONG POLITICAL LEADERS AND HEALTH EXPERTS USED TWITTER TO CREATE AND MANAGE MESSAGES ABOUT THE VACCINATION PROCESS. SPECIFICALLY, WE SHOW THE ISSUES (ISSUE FRAME) AND STRATEGIES (GAME FRAME) APPLIED BY THESE ACTORS. THIS STUDY EMPLOYS A CORPUS ON THE WORDS ""COVID-19"" AND ""VACCINES"" USED ON TWITTER BY THE HEADS OF GOVERNMENT AND 10 RECOGNIZED HEALTH EXPERTS (TWO FOR EACH COUNTRY) IN THE US, THE UK, FRANCE, PORTUGAL, AND SPAIN. WE ALSO ANALYZE THE ACCOUNTS OF FACT-CHECKING PROJECTS ON THOSE COUNTRIES (@POLITIFACT, @FULLFACT, @DECODEURS, @JORNALPOLIGRAFO, AND @MALDITA). THE SAMPLE ALLOWS THE COMPARISON OF COUNTRIES WITH DIFFERENT POLITICAL CULTURES THAT PARTICIPATED DIFFERENTLY IN THE PRODUCTION OF VACCINES. THE DATA WERE CAPTURED FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE VACCINATION DRIVE (DECEMBER 14TH, 2020) UNTIL MOST OF THE POPULATION ABOVE 60 WERE VACCINATED (MAY 14TH, 2021). A MANUAL CONTENT ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED ON THE TWEETS (N = 2,607). THE RESULTS ILLUSTRATE THAT THE POLITICIANS MOSTLY DISAGREED WITH EXPERTS REGARDING ISSUES AND STRATEGIES. THIS FINDING CAN FOSTER DISTRUST IN THE ELITES AND, THEREFORE, THREATENS THE LONG-TERM SUCCESS OF A PUBLIC HEALTH CAMPAIGN.

b-296,UNDERSTANDING COVID19 VACCINE HESITANCY IN ETHNIC MINORITIES GROUPS IN THE UK,"COVID-19 VACCINES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED AND ADMINISTERED AT RECORD PACE IN ORDER TO CURTAIL THE IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. VACCINE HESITANCY HAS IMPACTED UPTAKE UNEQUALLY ACROSS DIFFERENT GROUPS. THIS STUDY EXPLORES THE DRIVERS FOR VACCINE HESITANCY IN ETHNIC MINORITY GROUPS IN THE UK, THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL MEDIA ON VACCINE HESITANCY AND HOW VACCINE HESITANCY MAY BE OVERCOME. TWELVE SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED, CODED AND THEMATICALLY ANALYZED WITH PARTICIPANTS FROM ETHNIC MINORITY GROUPS IN THE UK WHO IDENTIFIED AS VACCINE HESITANT. SOCIAL MEDIA PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN VACCINE HESITANCY. FOR THOSE WHO CONSIDERED THEMSELVES HEALTHY, SEEING MISINFORMATION OF EXTREME SIDE EFFECTS RELATING TO COVID-19 VACCINATIONS ON SOCIAL MEDIA RESULTED IN THE OPINION THAT THE RISK OF VACCINATION IS GREATER THAN RISK FROM COVID-19 INFECTION. FOR WOMEN, MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA REGARDING FERTILITY WAS A REASON FOR DELAYING OR NOT GETTING VACCINATED. PARTICIPANTS WHO HAD SOURCES OF INFORMATION THEY TRUSTED IN OUTSIDE OF SOCIAL MEDIA WERE MORE LIKELY TO CHOOSE TO GET VACCINATED. THIS STUDY IDENTIFIED THE BROAD SPECTRUM OF VIEWS ON VACCINE HESITANCY IN ETHNIC MINORITY GROUPS IN THE UK. ENABLING FACTORS SUCH AS A DESIRE TO TRAVEL, AND POSITIVE PUBLIC HEALTH MESSAGING CAN INCREASE VACCINE UPTAKE, WHEREAS A LACK OF TRUSTED SOURCES OF INFORMATION MAY CAUSE VACCINE HESITANCY. FURTHER RESEARCH IS REQUIRED TO COMBAT MISINFORMATION AND CONSPIRACY THEORIES. EFFECTIVE METHODS INCLUDE ACTIVELY RESPONDING AND DISPROVING THE MISINFORMATION.

OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO CHARACTERIZE THE FALSE OR MISLEADING FLUORIDE-RELATED CONTENT ON INSTAGRAM. METHODS: A TOTAL OF 3863 POSTS RANKED BY USERS' TOTAL INTERACTION AND PUBLISHED BETWEEN AUGUST 2016 AND AUGUST 2021 WERE RETRIEVED BY CROWDTANGLE, OF WHICH 641 WERE SCREENED TO OBTAIN 500 FINAL POSTS. SUBSEQUENTLY, TWO INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATORS ANALYZED POSTS QUALITATIVELY TO DEFINE THEIR AUTHORS' INTERESTS, PROFILE CHARACTERISTICS, CONTENT TYPE, AND SENTIMENT. LATENT DIRICHLET ALLOCATION ANALYSIS TOPIC MODELING WAS THEN APPLIED TO FIND SALIENT TERMS AND TOPICS RELATED TO FALSE OR MISLEADING CONTENT, AND THEIR SIMILARITY WAS CALCULATED THROUGH AN INTERTOPIC DISTANCE MAP. DATA WERE EVALUATED BY DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS, THE MANN-WHITNEY U TEST, THE CRAMER V TEST, AND MULTIPLE LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODELS. RESULTS: MOST OF THE POSTS WERE CATEGORIZED AS MISINFORMATION AND POLITICAL MISINFORMATION. THE OVERPERFORMING SCORE WAS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH OLDER MESSAGES (ODDS RATIO [OR]=3.293, P<.001) AND PROFESSIONAL/POLITICAL MISINFORMATION (OR=1.944, P=.05). IN THIS CONTEXT, TIME FROM PUBLICATION, NEGATIVE/NEUTRAL SENTIMENT, AUTHOR'S PROFILE LINKED TO BUSINESS/DENTAL OFFICE/NEWS AGENCY, AND SOCIAL AND POLITICAL INTERESTS WERE RELATED TO THE INCREMENT OF PERFORMANCE OF MESSAGES. ALTHOUGH POLITICAL MISINFORMATION WITH NEGATIVE/NEUTRAL SENTIMENTS WAS TYPICALLY PUBLISHED BY REGULAR USERS, MISINFORMATION WAS LINKED TO POSITIVE COMMERCIAL POSTS.

THIS PAPER STUDIES THE IMPACT OF A VIRTUAL RUMOR CONTROL CENTER (RCC) ON WEIBO USER BEHAVIOR. THE COLLECTED COVID-19 BREAKING NEWS STORIES WERE DIVIDED INTO POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, AND NEUTRAL CATEGORIES, WHILE THE MODERATING EFFECT MODEL WAS USED TO ANALYZE THE INFLUENCE OF ANTI-RUMOR ON USER BEHAVIOR (FORWARDING, LIKING, AND COMMENTING). OUR RESEARCH FOUND THAT RUMOR REFUTING DOES NOT DIRECTLY AFFECT USER BEHAVIOR BUT DOES HAVE AN INDIRECT MODERATING EFFECT. RUMOR REFUTING HAS A PROFOUND IMPACT ON USER FORWARDING BEHAVIOR IN CASES OF POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE NEWS. SPECIFICALLY, WHEN THE EPIDEMIC BECOMES MORE SERIOUS, THE ROLE OF RUMOR REFUTING BECOMES CRITICAL, AND VICE VERSA. REFUTING RUMORS REDUCES USER WILLINGNESS TO FORWARD POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE NEWS, WITH MORE IMPACT ON NEGATIVE NEWS. TIME LAG ANALYSIS SHOWS A SIGNIFICANT MODERATION OF UNVERIFIED NEWS WITHIN 72 H OF REFUTING RUMORS BUT INDICATED AN APPARENT WEAKENING TREND OVER TIME.

HOWEVER, ACCEPTANCE OF THE VACCINE HAS BEEN AFFECTED BY FALSE INFORMATION AND RUMORS, WHICH HAVE KEPT PEOPLE FROM GETTING THE SHOT SINCE IT WAS ROLLED OUT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THIS STUDY AIMED TO INVESTIGATE THE VARIOUS MISCONCEPTIONS SURFACED ABOUT THE COVID-19 VACCINES IN AFRICA. WE PERFORMED AN ONLINE SURVEY USING AN ANONYMOUS QUESTIONNAIRE TO REACH OUT TO AFRICAN RESPONDENTS BY SOCIAL MEDIA AND ALL POSSIBLE ONLINE PLATFORMS SUCH AS FACEBOOK, WHATSAPP, INSTAGRAM, TWITTER, YOUTUBE, AND SO FORTH. THE WEB-BASED QUESTIONNAIRES ABOUT THE MYTHS SURROUNDING THE VACCINES WERE EXTRACTED FROM NONSCIENTIFIC INFORMATION, UNPROVEN STATEMENTS, SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS, NEWS REPORTS, AND PEOPLE'S CONCERNS ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THE COVID-19 VACCINES. PARTICIPANTS INDICATED THEIR LEVEL OF AGREEMENT WITH EACH STATEMENT. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 2,500 PEOPLE RESPONDED TO THE ONLINE SURVEY IN AFRICA. THE TWO COMMON MYTHS THAT RESPONDENTS AGREED WITH WERE THAT ""SINCE VACCINES FOR COVID-19 HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED, WE CAN MAKE VACCINES FOR THE COMMON COLD, HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUSES, AND OTHER DISEASES"" (N= 892, 35.7%) AND THAT ""RESEARCHERS RUSHED THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COVID-19 VACCINES; THEREFORE, IT IS NOT VERY EFFECTIVE, SAFE AND CANNOT BE TRUSTED"" (N=595, 23.8%). THE RANGE OF RESPONDENTS WHO NEITHER AGREED NOR DISAGREED WITH THESE MYTHS WAS 12.4%-33.0%.

SPECIFICALLY, THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE COVID-19 FEAR USING THE SURVEY DATA COLLECTED FROM A DEVELOPING COUNTRY. IN TOTAL, 880 ENTRIES WERE USED TO ANALYZE THE COVID-19 FEAR USING THE AMOS SOFTWARE. FINDINGS INDICATED THAT INFORMATION-SEEKING AND SHARING BEHAVIOR OF INDIVIDUALS ON SOCIAL MEDIA HAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON PERCEIVED COVID-19 INFORMATION OVERLOAD. PERCEIVED COVID-19 INFORMATION OVERLOAD HAS A POSITIVE IMPACT ON COVID-19 FEAR.

DESIGN YOUNG ADULTS AGED 18-34 YEARS (N=1225) WERE SURVEYED CROSS-SECTIONALLY VIA ONLINE QUALTRICS PANEL. THE SURVEY ASSESSED RECALL AND BELIEF IN THREE CLAIMS ABOUT NICOTINE AND COVID-19 AND THREE ABOUT NICOTINE IN GENERAL FOLLOWED BY ASSESSMENTS OF INDUSTRY BELIEFS AND USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA. ORDINAL LOGISTIC REGRESSION WITH ROBUST STANDARD ERRORS CONTROLLING FOR GENDER, RACE/ETHNICITY, EDUCATION, CURRENT E-CIGARETTE USE AND AGE WAS USED TO EXAMINE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN VARIABLES. RESULTS TWITTER USE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER ODDS OF RECALL (OR=1.21, 95% CI=1.01 TO 1.44) AND BELIEF (OR=1.26, 95% CI=1.04 TO 1.52) IN COVID-19-SPECIFIC DISTORTED SCIENCE. YOUTUBE USE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER ODDS OF BELIEVING COVID-19-SPECIFIC DISTORTED SCIENCE (OR=1.32, 95% CI=1.09 TO 1.60). REDDIT USE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER ODDS OF BELIEVING COVID-19-SPECIFIC DISTORTED SCIENCE (OR=0.72, 95% CI=0.59 TO 0.88). RECALL (OR=1.26, 95% CI=1.07 TO 1.47) AND BELIEF (OR=1.28, 95% CI=1.09 TO 1.50) IN DISTORTED SCIENCE ABOUT NICOTINE IN GENERAL AS WELL AS BELIEF IN DISTORTED SCIENCE SPECIFIC TO COVID-19 (OR=1.61, 95% CI=1.34 TO 1.95) WERE ASSOCIATED WITH MORE POSITIVE BELIEFS ABOUT THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY. BELIEF IN DISTORTED SCIENCE ABOUT NICOTINE IN GENERAL WAS ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH MORE NEGATIVE BELIEFS ABOUT THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY (OR=1.18, 95% CI=1.02 TO 1.35). CONCLUSIONS USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS MAY HELP TO BOTH SPREAD AND DISPEL DISTORTED SCIENCE ABOUT NICOTINE.

THUS, IT IS NO SURPRISE THAT IT HAS ALSO BEEN THE TOPIC OF A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF MISINFORMATION, WHICH WAS MOST LIKELY AMPLIFIED BY THE FACT THAT MANY DETAILS ABOUT THE VIRUS WERE NOT KNOWN AT THE START OF THE PANDEMIC. WHILE A LARGE AMOUNT OF THIS MISINFORMATION WAS HARMLESS, SOME NARRATIVES SPREAD QUICKLY AND HAD A DRAMATIC REAL-WORLD EFFECT. SUCH EVENTS ARE CALLED DIGITAL WILDFIRES. IN THIS PAPER WE STUDY A SPECIFIC DIGITAL WILDFIRE: THE IDEA THAT THE COVID-19 OUTBREAK IS SOMEHOW CONNECTED TO THE INTRODUCTION OF 5G WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY, WHICH CAUSED REAL-WORLD HARM IN APRIL 2020 AND BEYOND. BY ANALYZING EARLY SOCIAL MEDIA CONTENTS WE INVESTIGATE THE ORIGIN OF THIS DIGITAL WILDFIRE AND THE DEVELOPMENTS THAT LEAD TO ITS WIDE SPREAD. WE SHOW HOW THE INITIAL IDEA WAS DERIVED FROM EXISTING OPPOSITION TO WIRELESS NETWORKS, HOW VIDEOS RATHER THAN TWEETS PLAYED A CRUCIAL ROLE IN ITS PROPAGATION, AND HOW COMMERCIAL INTERESTS CAN PARTIALLY EXPLAIN THE WIDE DISTRIBUTION OF THIS PARTICULAR PIECE OF MISINFORMATION.

b-403,MISINFORMATION ABOUT THE HUMAN GUT MICROBIOME IN YOUTUBE VIDEOS CROSSSECTIONAL STUDY,"BACKGROUND: SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS SUCH AS YOUTUBE ARE INTEGRAL TOOLS FOR DISSEMINATING INFORMATION ABOUT HEALTH AND WELLNESS TO THE PUBLIC. HOWEVER, ANECDOTAL REPORTS HAVE CITED THAT THE HUMAN GUT MICROBIOME HAS BEEN A PARTICULAR FOCUS OF DUBIOUS, MISLEADING, AND, ON OCCASION, HARMFUL MEDIA CONTENT. DESPITE THESE CLAIMS, THERE HAVE BEEN NO PUBLISHED STUDIES INVESTIGATING THIS PHENOMENON WITHIN POPULAR SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO (1) EVALUATE THE ACCURACY AND RELIABILITY OF THE CONTENT IN YOUTUBE VIDEOS RELATED TO THE HUMAN GUT MICROBIOME AND (2) INVESTIGATE THE CORRELATION BETWEEN CONTENT ENGAGEMENT METRICS AND VIDEO QUALITY, AS DEFINED BY VALIDATED CRITERIA. METHODS: IN THIS CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY, VIDEOS ABOUT THE HUMAN GUT MICROBIOME WERE SEARCHED FOR ON THE UNITED KINGDOM VERSION OF YOUTUBE ON SEPTEMBER 20, 2021. THE 600 MOST-VIEWED VIDEOS WERE EXTRACTED AND SCREENED FOR RELEVANCE. THE CONTENTS AND CHARACTERISTICS OF THE VIDEOS WERE EXTRACTED AND INDEPENDENTLY RATED USING THE DISCERN QUALITY CRITERIA BY 2 RESEARCHERS. RESULTS: OVERALL, 319 VIDEOS ACCOUNTING FOR 62,354,628 VIEWS WERE INCLUDED. OF THE 319 VIDEOS, 73.4% (N=234) WERE PRODUCED IN NORTH AMERICA AND 78.7% (N=251) WERE UPLOADED BETWEEN 2019 AND 2021. A TOTAL OF 41.1% (131/319) OF VIDEOS WERE PRODUCED BY NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS. OF THE VIDEOS, 16.3% (52/319) INCLUDED AN ADVERTISEMENT FOR A PRODUCT OR PROMOTED A HEALTH-RELATED INTERVENTION FOR FINANCIAL PURPOSES. VIDEOS BY NONMEDICAL EDUCATION CREATORS HAD THE HIGHEST TOTAL AND PREFERRED VIEWERSHIP. DAILY VIEWERSHIP WAS THE HIGHEST FOR VIDEOS BY INTERNET MEDIA SOURCES. THE AVERAGE DISCERN AND HEALTH ON THE NET FOUNDATION CODE OF CONDUCT SCORES WERE 49.5 (SE 0.68) OUT OF 80 AND 5.05 (SE 2.52) OUT OF 8, RESPECTIVELY. DISCERN SCORES FOR VIDEOS BY MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS (MEAN 53.2, SE 0.17) WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN FOR VIDEOS BY INDEPENDENT CONTENT CREATORS (MEAN 39.1, SE 5.58; P<.001). VIDEOS INCLUDING PROMOTIONAL MATERIALS HAD SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER DISCERN SCORES THAN VIDEOS WITHOUT ANY ADVERTISEMENTS OR PRODUCT PROMOTION (P<.001). THERE WAS NO CORRELATION BETWEEN DISCERN SCORES AND TOTAL VIEWERSHIP, DAILY VIEWERSHIP, OR PREFERRED VIEWERSHIP (NUMBER OF LIKES). CONCLUSIONS: THE OVERALL QUALITY AND RELIABILITY OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE HUMAN GUT MICROBIOME ON YOUTUBE IS GENERALLY POOR. MOREOVER, THERE WAS NO CORRELATION BETWEEN THE QUALITY OF A VIDEO AND THE LEVEL OF PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT.

b-412,MISINFORMATION IN ITALIAN ONLINE MENTAL HEALTH COMMUNITIES DURING THE COVID19 PANDEMIC PROTOCOL FOR A CONTENT ANALYSIS STUDY,"BACKGROUND: SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS ARE WIDELY USED BY PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM MENTAL ILLNESSES TO COPE WITH THEIR CONDITIONS. ONE MODALITY OF COPING WITH THESE CONDITIONS IS NAVIGATING ONLINE COMMUNITIES WHERE PEOPLE CAN RECEIVE EMOTIONAL SUPPORT AND INFORMATIONAL ADVICE. BENEFITS HAVE BEEN DOCUMENTED IN TERMS OF IMPACT ON HEALTH OUTCOMES. HOWEVER, THE PITFALLS ARE STILL UNKNOWN, AS NOT ALL CONTENT IS NECESSARILY HELPFUL OR CORRECT. FURTHERMORE, THE ADVENT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND RELATED PROBLEMS, SUCH AS WORSENING MENTAL HEALTH SYMPTOMS, THE DISSEMINATION OF CONSPIRACY NARRATIVES, AND MEDICAL DISTRUST, MAY HAVE IMPACTED THESE ONLINE COMMUNITIES. THE SITUATION IN ITALY IS OF PARTICULAR INTEREST, BEING THE FIRST WESTERN COUNTRY TO EXPERIENCE A NATIONWIDE LOCKDOWN. PARTICULARLY DURING THIS CHALLENGING TIME, THE BENEFICIAL ROLE OF COMMUNITY MODERATORS WITH PROFESSIONAL MENTAL HEALTH EXPERTISE NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED IN TERMS OF UNCOVERING MISLEADING INFORMATION AND REGULATING COMMUNITIES. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THE PROPOSED STUDY IS TO INVESTIGATE THE POTENTIALLY HARMFUL CONTENT FOUND IN ONLINE COMMUNITIES FOR MENTAL HEALTH SYMPTOMS IN THE ITALIAN LANGUAGE. BESIDES DESCRIPTIVE INFORMATION ABOUT THE CONTENT THAT POSTS AND COMMENTS ADDRESS, THIS STUDY AIMS TO ANALYZE THE CONTENT FROM TWO VIEWPOINTS. THE FIRST ONE COMPARES EXPERT-LED AND PEER-LED COMMUNITIES, FOCUSING ON DIFFERENCES IN MISINFORMATION. THE SECOND ONE UNRAVELS THE IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, NOT BY MERELY INVESTIGATING DIFFERENCES IN TOPICS BUT ALSO BY INVESTIGATING THE NEEDS EXPRESSED BY COMMUNITY MEMBERS. METHODS: A CODEBOOK FOR THE CONTENT ANALYSIS OF FACEBOOK COMMUNITIES HAS BEEN DEVELOPED, AND A CONTENT ANALYSIS WILL BE CONDUCTED ON BUNDLES OF POSTS. AMONG 14 FACEBOOK GROUPS THAT WERE INTERESTED IN PARTICIPATING IN THIS STUDY, TWO GROUPS WERE SELECTED FOR ANALYSIS: ONE WAS BEING MODERATED BY A HEALTH PROFESSIONAL (N=12,058 MEMBERS) AND ONE WAS LED BY PEERS (N=5598 MEMBERS). UTTERANCES FROM 3 CONSECUTIVE CALENDAR YEARS WILL BE STUDIED BY COMPARING THE MONTHS FROM BEFORE THE PANDEMIC, THE MONTHS DURING THE HEIGHT OF THE PANDEMIC, AND THE MONTHS DURING THE POSTPANDEMIC PHASE (2019-2021). THIS METHOD PERMITS THE IDENTIFICATION OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF MISINFORMATION AND THE CONTEXT IN WHICH THEY EMERGE. ETHICAL APPROVAL WAS OBTAINED BY THE UNIVERSITA DELLA SVIZZERA ITALIANA ETHICS COMMITTEE. RESULTS: THE USABILITY OF THE CODEBOOK WAS DEMONSTRATED WITH A PRETEST. SUBSEQUENTLY, 144 THREADS (1534 UTTERANCES) WERE CODED BY THE TWO CODERS. INTERCODER RELIABILITY WAS CALCULATED ON 293 UNITS (19.10% OF THE TOTAL SAMPLE; KRIPPENDORFF ALPHA=.94, RANGE.72-1). ASIDE FROM A FEW ANALYSES COMPARING BUNDLES, INDIVIDUAL UTTERANCES WILL CONSTITUTE THE UNIT OF ANALYSIS IN MOST CASES.

WE FIND EVIDENCE THAT SOCIAL BOTS PLAYED A DISPROPORTIONATE ROLE IN SPREADING ARTICLES FROM LOW-CREDIBILITY SOURCES. BOTS AMPLIFY SUCH CONTENT IN THE EARLY SPREADING MOMENTS, BEFORE AN ARTICLE GOES VIRAL. THEY ALSO TARGET USERS WITH MANY FOLLOWERS THROUGH REPLIES AND MENTIONS. HUMANS ARE VULNERABLE TO THIS MANIPULATION, RESHARING CONTENT POSTED BY BOTS. SUCCESSFUL LOW-CREDIBILITY SOURCES ARE HEAVILY SUPPORTED BY SOCIAL BOTS.

113,PRIOR EXPOSURE INCREASES PERCEIVED ACCURACY OF FAKE NEWS,"THE 2016 U.S. PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION BROUGHT CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON OF ""FAKE NEWS"": ENTIRELY FABRICATED AND OFTEN PARTISAN CONTENT THAT IS PRESENTED AS FACTUAL. HERE WE DEMONSTRATE ONE MECHANISM THAT CONTRIBUTES TO THE BELIEVABILITY OF FAKE NEWS: FLUENCY VIA PRIOR EXPOSURE. USING ACTUAL FAKE-NEWS HEADLINES PRESENTED AS THEY WERE SEEN ON FACEBOOK, WE SHOW THAT EVEN A SINGLE EXPOSURE INCREASES SUBSEQUENT PERCEPTIONS OF ACCURACY, BOTH WITHIN THE SAME SESSION AND AFTER A WEEK. MOREOVER, THIS ""ILLUSORY TRUTH EFFECT"" FOR FAKE-NEWS HEADLINES OCCURS DESPITE A LOW LEVEL OF OVERALL BELIEVABILITY AND EVEN WHEN THE STORIES ARE LABELED AS CONTESTED BY FACT CHECKERS OR ARE INCONSISTENT WITH THE READER'S POLITICAL IDEOLOGY. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS HELP TO INCUBATE BELIEF IN BLATANTLY FALSE NEWS STORIES AND THAT TAGGING SUCH STORIES AS DISPUTED IS NOT AN EFFECTIVE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM. IT IS INTERESTING, HOWEVER, THAT WE ALSO FOUND THAT PRIOR EXPOSURE DOES NOT IMPACT ENTIRELY IMPLAUSIBLE STATEMENTS (E.G., ""THE EARTH IS A PERFECT SQUARE""). THESE OBSERVATIONS INDICATE THAT ALTHOUGH EXTREME IMPLAUSIBILITY IS A BOUNDARY CONDITION OF THE ILLUSORY TRUTH EFFECT, ONLY A SMALL DEGREE OF POTENTIAL PLAUSIBILITY IS SUFFICIENT FOR REPETITION TO INCREASE PERCEIVED ACCURACY.

594,CORONAVIRUS GOES VIRAL QUANTIFYING THE COVID19 MISINFORMATION EPIDEMIC ON TWITTER,"BACKGROUND SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 (COVID-19) EPIDEMIC, MISINFORMATION HAS BEEN SPREADING UNINHIBITED OVER TRADITIONAL AND SOCIAL MEDIA AT A RAPID PACE. WE SOUGHT TO ANALYZE THE MAGNITUDE OF MISINFORMATION THAT IS BEING SPREAD ON TWITTER (TWITTER, INC., SAN FRANCISCO, CA) REGARDING THE CORONAVIRUS EPIDEMIC. MATERIALS AND METHODS WE CONDUCTED A SEARCH ON TWITTER USING 14 DIFFERENT TRENDING HASHTAGS AND KEYWORDS RELATED TO THE COVID-19 EPIDEMIC. WE THEN SUMMARIZED AND ASSESSED INDIVIDUAL TWEETS FOR MISINFORMATION IN COMPARISON TO VERIFIED AND PEER-REVIEWED RESOURCES. DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS WERE USED TO COMPARE TERMS AND HASHTAGS, AND TO IDENTIFY INDIVIDUAL TWEETS AND ACCOUNT CHARACTERISTICS. RESULTS THE STUDY INCLUDED 673 TWEETS. MOST TWEETS WERE POSTED BY INFORMAL INDIVIDUALS/GROUPS (66%), AND 129 (19.2%) BELONGED TO VERIFIED TWITTER ACCOUNTS. THE MAJORITY OF INCLUDED TWEETS CONTAINED SERIOUS CONTENT (91.2%); 548 TWEETS (81.4%) INCLUDED GENUINE INFORMATION PERTAINING TO THE COVID-19 EPIDEMIC. AROUND 70% OF THE TWEETS TACKLED MEDICAL/PUBLIC HEALTH INFORMATION, WHILE THE OTHERS WERE PERTAINING TO SOCIOPOLITICAL AND FINANCIAL FACTORS. IN TOTAL, 153 TWEETS (24.8%) INCLUDED MISINFORMATION, AND 107 (17.4%) INCLUDED UNVERIFIABLE INFORMATION REGARDING THE COVID-19 EPIDEMIC. THE RATE OF MISINFORMATION WAS HIGHER AMONG INFORMAL INDIVIDUAL/GROUP ACCOUNTS (33.8%, P: <0.001). TWEETS FROM UNVERIFIED TWITTER ACCOUNTS CONTAINED MORE MISINFORMATION (31.0% VS 12.6% FOR VERIFIED ACCOUNTS, P: <0.001). TWEETS FROM HEALTHCARE/PUBLIC HEALTH ACCOUNTS HAD THE LOWEST RATE OF UNVERIFIABLE INFORMATION (12.3%, P: 0.04). THE NUMBER OF LIKES AND RETWEETS PER TWEET WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH A DIFFERENCE IN EITHER FALSE OR UNVERIFIABLE CONTENT. THE KEYWORD ""COVID-19"" HAD THE LOWEST RATE OF MISINFORMATION AND UNVERIFIABLE INFORMATION, WHILE THE KEYWORDS ""#2019_NCOV"" AND ""CORONA"" WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE HIGHEST AMOUNT OF MISINFORMATION AND UNVERIFIABLE CONTENT RESPECTIVELY. CONCLUSIONS MEDICAL MISINFORMATION AND UNVERIFIABLE CONTENT PERTAINING TO THE GLOBAL COVID-19 EPIDEMIC ARE BEING PROPAGATED AT AN ALARMING RATE ON SOCIAL MEDIA.

17,SCIENCE VS CONSPIRACY COLLECTIVE NARRATIVES IN THE AGE OF MISINFORMATION,"THE LARGE AVAILABILITY OF USER PROVIDED CONTENTS ON ONLINE SOCIAL MEDIA FACILITATES PEOPLE AGGREGATION AROUND SHARED BELIEFS, INTERESTS, WORLDVIEWS AND NARRATIVES. IN SPITE OF THE ENTHUSIASTIC RHETORIC ABOUT THE SO CALLED COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE UNSUBSTANTIATED RUMORS AND CONSPIRACY THEORIES - E.G., CHEMTRAILS, REPTILIANS OR THE ILLUMINATI - ARE PERVASIVE IN ONLINE SOCIAL NETWORKS (OSN). IN THIS WORK WE STUDY, ON A SAMPLE OF 1.2 MILLION OF INDIVIDUALS, HOW INFORMATION RELATED TO VERY DISTINCT NARRATIVES-I.E. MAIN STREAM SCIENTIFIC AND CONSPIRACY NEWS - ARE CONSUMED AND SHAPE COMMUNITIES ON FACEBOOK. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT POLARIZED COMMUNITIES EMERGE AROUND DISTINCT TYPES OF CONTENTS AND USUAL CONSUMERS OF CONSPIRACY NEWS RESULT TO BE MORE FOCUSED AND SELF-CONTAINED ON THEIR SPECIFIC CONTENTS. TO TEST POTENTIAL BIASES INDUCED BY THE CONTINUED EXPOSURE TO UNSUBSTANTIATED RUMORS ON USERS' CONTENT SELECTION, WE CONCLUDE OUR ANALYSIS MEASURING HOW USERS RESPOND TO 4,709 TROLL INFORMATION - I.E. PARODISTIC AND SARCASTIC IMITATION OF CONSPIRACY THEORIES. WE FIND THAT 77.92% OF LIKES AND 80.86% OF COMMENTS ARE FROM USERS USUALLY INTERACTING WITH CONSPIRACY STORIES.

THIS STUDY SEEKS TO BRIDGE THESE TWO AREAS, CONSIDERING THE ROLE THAT SOCIAL MEDIA MAY PLAY IN CORRECTING MISINFORMATION. TO DO SO, WE TEST A NEW FUNCTION OF FACEBOOK, WHICH PROVIDES RELATED LINKS WHEN PEOPLE CLICK ON A LINK WITHIN FACEBOOK. WE SHOW USERS A POST CONTAINING MISINFORMATION, AND THEN MANIPULATE THE RELATED STORIES TO EITHER CONFIRM, CORRECT, OR BOTH CONFIRM AND CORRECT THE MISINFORMATION. FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT WHEN RELATED STORIES CORRECT A POST THAT INCLUDES MISINFORMATION, MISPERCEPTIONS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED.

487,COVID19 AND THE 5G CONSPIRACY THEORY SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS OF TWITTER DATA,"BACKGROUND: SINCE THE BEGINNING OF DECEMBER 2019, THE CORONAVIRUS DISEASE (COVID-19) HAS SPREAD RAPIDLY AROUND THE WORLD, WHICH HAS LED TO INCREASED DISCUSSIONS ACROSS ONLINE PLATFORMS. THESE CONVERSATIONS HAVE ALSO INCLUDED VARIOUS CONSPIRACIES SHARED BY SOCIAL MEDIA USERS. AMONGST THEM, A POPULAR THEORY HAS LINKED 5G TO THE SPREAD OF COVID-19, LEADING TO MISINFORMATION AND THE BURNING OF 5G TOWERS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM. THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE DRIVERS OF FAKE NEWS AND QUICK POLICIES ORIENTED TO ISOLATE AND REBATE MISINFORMATION ARE KEYS TO COMBATING IT. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO DEVELOP AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE DRIVERS OF THE 5G COVID-19 CONSPIRACY THEORY AND STRATEGIES TO DEAL WITH SUCH MISINFORMATION. METHODS: THIS PAPER PERFORMS A SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS AND CONTENT ANALYSIS OF TWITTER DATA FROM A 7-DAY PERIOD (FRIDAY, MARCH 27, 2020, TO SATURDAY, APRIL 4, 2020) IN WHICH THE #5GCORONAVIRUS HASHTAG WAS TRENDING ON TWITTER IN THE UNITED KINGDOM. INFLUENTIAL USERS WERE ANALYZED THROUGH SOCIAL NETWORK GRAPH CLUSTERS. THE SIZE OF THE NODES WERE RANKED BY THEIR BETWEENNESS CENTRALITY SCORE, AND THE GRAPH'S VERTICES WERE GROUPED BY CLUSTER USING THE CLAUSET-NEWMAN-MOORE ALGORITHM. THE TOPICS AND WEB SOURCES USED WERE ALSO EXAMINED. RESULTS: SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS IDENTIFIED THAT THE TWO LARGEST NETWORK STRUCTURES CONSISTED OF AN ISOLATES GROUP AND A BROADCAST GROUP. THE ANALYSIS ALSO REVEALED THAT THERE WAS A LACK OF AN AUTHORITY FIGURE WHO WAS ACTIVELY COMBATING SUCH MISINFORMATION. CONTENT ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT, OF 233 SAMPLE TWEETS, 34.8% (N=81) CONTAINED VIEWS THAT 5G AND COVID-19 WERE LINKED, 32.2% (N=75) DENOUNCED THE CONSPIRACY THEORY, AND 33.0% (N=77) WERE GENERAL TWEETS NOT EXPRESSING ANY PERSONAL VIEWS OR OPINIONS. THUS, 65.2% (N=152) OF TWEETS DERIVED FROM NONCONSPIRACY THEORY SUPPORTERS, WHICH SUGGESTS THAT, ALTHOUGH THE TOPIC ATTRACTED HIGH VOLUME, ONLY A HANDFUL OF USERS GENUINELY BELIEVED THE CONSPIRACY. THIS PAPER ALSO SHOWS THAT FAKE NEWS WEBSITES WERE THE MOST POPULAR WEB SOURCE SHARED BY USERS; ALTHOUGH, YOUTUBE VIDEOS WERE ALSO SHARED. THE STUDY ALSO IDENTIFIED AN ACCOUNT WHOSE SOLE AIM WAS TO SPREAD THE CONSPIRACY THEORY ON TWITTER. CONCLUSIONS: THE COMBINATION OF QUICK AND TARGETED INTERVENTIONS ORIENTED TO DELEGITIMIZE THE SOURCES OF FAKE INFORMATION IS KEY TO REDUCING THEIR IMPACT. THOSE USERS VOICING THEIR VIEWS AGAINST THE CONSPIRACY THEORY, LINK BAITING, OR SHARING HUMOROUS TWEETS INADVERTENTLY RAISED THE PROFILE OF THE TOPIC, SUGGESTING THAT POLICYMAKERS SHOULD INSIST IN THE EFFORTS OF ISOLATING OPINIONS THAT ARE BASED ON FAKE NEWS. MANY SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS PROVIDE USERS WITH THE ABILITY TO REPORT INAPPROPRIATE CONTENT, WHICH SHOULD BE USED. THIS STUDY IS THE FIRST TO ANALYZE THE 5G CONSPIRACY THEORY IN THE CONTEXT OF COVID-19 ON TWITTER OFFERING PRACTICAL GUIDANCE TO HEALTH AUTHORITIES IN HOW, IN THE CONTEXT OF A PANDEMIC, RUMORS MAY BE COMBATED IN THE FUTURE.

6,PREDICTING INFORMATION CREDIBILITY IN TIMESENSITIVE SOCIAL MEDIA,"PURPOSE: TWITTER IS A POPULAR MICROBLOGGING SERVICE WHICH HAS PROVEN, IN RECENT YEARS, ITS POTENTIAL FOR PROPAGATING NEWS AND INFORMATION ABOUT DEVELOPING EVENTS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO FOCUS ON THE ANALYSIS OF INFORMATION CREDIBILITY ON TWITTER. THE PURPOSE OF OUR RESEARCH IS TO ESTABLISH IF AN AUTOMATIC DISCOVERY PROCESS OF RELEVANT AND CREDIBLE NEWS EVENTS CAN BE ACHIEVED. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: THE PAPER FOLLOWS A SUPERVISED LEARNING APPROACH FOR THE TASK OF AUTOMATIC CLASSIFICATION OF CREDIBLE NEWS EVENTS. A FIRST CLASSIFIER DECIDES IF AN INFORMATION CASCADE CORRESPONDS TO A NEWSWORTHY EVENT. THEN A SECOND CLASSIFIER DECIDES IF THIS CASCADE CAN BE CONSIDERED CREDIBLE OR NOT. THE PAPER UNDERTAKES THIS EFFORT TRAINING OVER A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF LABELED DATA, OBTAINED USING CROWDSOURCING TOOLS. THE PAPER VALIDATES THESE CLASSIFIERS UNDER TWO SETTINGS: THE FIRST, A SAMPLE OF AUTOMATICALLY DETECTED TWITTER ""TRENDS"" IN ENGLISH, AND SECOND, THE PAPER TESTS HOW WELL THIS MODEL TRANSFERS TO TWITTER TOPICS IN SPANISH, AUTOMATICALLY DETECTED DURING A NATURAL DISASTER. FINDINGS: THERE ARE MEASURABLE DIFFERENCES IN THE WAY MICROBLOG MESSAGES PROPAGATE. THE PAPER SHOWS THAT THESE DIFFERENCES ARE RELATED TO THE NEWSWORTHINESS AND CREDIBILITY OF THE INFORMATION CONVEYED, AND DESCRIBES FEATURES THAT ARE EFFECTIVE FOR CLASSIFYING INFORMATION AUTOMATICALLY AS CREDIBLE OR NOT CREDIBLE. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: THE PAPER FIRST TESTS THE APPROACH UNDER NORMAL CONDITIONS, AND THEN THE PAPER EXTENDS THE FINDINGS TO A DISASTER MANAGEMENT SITUATION, WHERE MANY NEWS AND RUMORS ARISE. ADDITIONALLY, BY ANALYZING THE TRANSFER OF OUR CLASSIFIERS ACROSS LANGUAGES, THE PAPER IS ABLE TO LOOK MORE DEEPLY INTO WHICH TOPIC-FEATURES ARE MORE RELEVANT FOR CREDIBILITY ASSESSMENT. TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE, THIS IS THE FIRST PAPER THAT STUDIES THE POWER OF PREDICTION OF SOCIAL MEDIA FOR INFORMATION CREDIBILITY, CONSIDERING MODEL TRANSFER INTO TIME-SENSITIVE AND LANGUAGE-SENSITIVE CONTEXTS.

2,YOUTUBE FOR INFORMATION ON RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS A WAKEUP CALL,"OBJECTIVE: RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS (RA) IS A COMMON DEBILITATING AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE, WITH UNMET NEED FOR KNOWLEDGE AMONG PATIENTS AND THE GENERAL POPULATION. YOUTUBE IS A POPULAR, CONSUMER-GENERATED, VIDEO-SHARING WEBSITE, WHICH CAN BE A SOURCE OF INFORMATION ON RA. WE INVESTIGATED THE QUALITY OF INFORMATION ON RA ON YOUTUBE AND ANALYZED AUDIENCE INTERACTION. METHODS: YOUTUBE WAS SEARCHED USING THE TERM ""RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS,"" FOR VIDEOS UPLOADED ON RA. TWO PHYSICIANS INDEPENDENTLY CLASSIFIED VIDEOS AS USEFUL, MISLEADING, OR PATIENT VIEWS, AND RATED THEM ON A 5-POINT GLOBAL QUALITY SCALE (GQS; 1 = POOR QUALITY, 5 = EXCELLENT QUALITY). USEFUL VIDEOS WERE RATED FOR RELIABILITY AND CONTENT, ON A 5-POINT SCALE (HIGHER SCORES REPRESENT MORE RELIABLE AND COMPREHENSIVE VIDEOS). SOURCE OF VIDEOS WAS ALSO NOTED. AUDIENCE INTERACTION WAS ASSESSED THROUGH VIDEO VIEWERSHIP. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 102 RELEVANT VIDEOS WERE IDENTIFIED; 54.9% WERE CLASSIFIED AS USEFUL (GQS 2.9 Ã‚Â± 1.0) AND 30.4% DEEMED MISLEADING (GQS 1.3 Ã‚Â± 1.6). MEAN RELIABILITY AND CONTENT SCORE OF USEFUL VIDEOS WAS 3.2 (Ã‚Â± 1.0) AND 2.5 (Ã‚Â± 1.2), RESPECTIVELY. ALL VIDEOS UPLOADED BY UNIVERSITY CHANNELS AND PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS PROVIDED USEFUL INFORMATION BUT FORMED ONLY 12.7% OF TOTAL VIDEOS, WHEREAS 73.9% OF MEDICAL ADVERTISEMENTS AND VIDEOS BY FOR-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS WERE MISLEADING. THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE IN THE VIEWERSHIP/DAY (https://doi.org/10.0 VS 21.5; P = NONSIGNIFICANT) OF USEFUL AND MISLEADING INFORMATION. CONCLUSION: YOUTUBE IS A SOURCE OF INFORMATION ON RA, OF VARIABLE QUALITY, WITH WIDE VIEWERSHIP AND POTENTIAL TO INFLUENCE PATIENTS' KNOWLEDGE AND BEHAVIOR. PHYSICIANS AND PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS SHOULD BE AWARE OF AND EMBRACE THIS EVOLVING TECHNOLOGY TO RAISE AWARENESS ABOUT RA, AND EMPOWER PATIENTS TO DISCRIMINATE USEFUL FROM MISLEADING INFORMATION.

103,SEE SOMETHING SAY SOMETHING CORRECTION OF GLOBAL HEALTH MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA,"SOCIAL MEDIA ARE OFTEN CRITICIZED FOR BEING A CONDUIT FOR MISINFORMATION ON GLOBAL HEALTH ISSUES, BUT MAY ALSO SERVE AS A CORRECTIVE TO FALSE INFORMATION. TO INVESTIGATE THIS POSSIBILITY, AN EXPERIMENT WAS CONDUCTED EXPOSING USERS TO A SIMULATED FACEBOOK NEWS FEED FEATURING MISINFORMATION AND DIFFERENT CORRECTION MECHANISMS (ONE IN WHICH NEWS STORIES FEATURING CORRECT INFORMATION WERE PRODUCED BY AN ALGORITHM AND ANOTHER WHERE THE CORRECTIVE NEWS STORIES WERE POSTED BY OTHER FACEBOOK USERS) ABOUT THE ZIKA VIRUS, A CURRENT GLOBAL HEALTH THREAT. RESULTS SHOW THAT ALGORITHMIC AND SOCIAL CORRECTIONS ARE EQUALLY EFFECTIVE IN LIMITING MISPERCEPTIONS, AND CORRECTION OCCURS FOR BOTH HIGH AND LOW CONSPIRACY BELIEF INDIVIDUALS. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGNS TO CORRECT GLOBAL HEALTH MISINFORMATION, INCLUDING ENCOURAGING USERS TO REFUTE FALSE OR MISLEADING HEALTH INFORMATION, AND PROVIDING THEM APPROPRIATE SOURCES TO ACCOMPANY THEIR REFUTATION, ARE DISCUSSED.

4,MISLEADING HEALTHRELATED INFORMATION PROMOTED THROUGH VIDEOBASED SOCIAL MEDIA ANOREXIA ON YOUTUBE,"INTRODUCTION: THE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION BEING UPLOADED ONTO SOCIAL VIDEO PLATFORMS, SUCH AS YOUTUBE, VIMEO, AND VEOH, CONTINUES TO SPIRAL, MAKING IT INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO DISCERN RELIABLE HEALTH INFORMATION FROM MISLEADING CONTENT. THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF YOUTUBE VIDEOS PROMOTING MISLEADING INFORMATION ABOUT ANOREXIA (EG, ANOREXIA AS A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE). OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE ANOREXIA-RELATED MISINFORMATION DISSEMINATED THROUGH YOUTUBE VIDEOS. METHODS: WE RETRIEVED YOUTUBE VIDEOS RELATED TO ANOREXIA USING THE KEYWORDS ANOREXIA, ANOREXIA NERVOSA, PROANA, AND THINSPO ON OCTOBER 10, 2011.THREE DOCTORS REVIEWED 140 VIDEOS WITH APPROXIMATELY 11 HOURS OF VIDEO CONTENT, CLASSIFYING THEM AS INFORMATIVE, PRO-ANOREXIA, OR OTHERS. BY INFORMATIVE WE MEAN CONTENT DESCRIBING THE HEALTH CONSEQUENCES OF ANOREXIA AND ADVICE ON HOW TO RECOVER FROM IT; BY PRO-ANOREXIA WE MEAN VIDEOS PROMOTING ANOREXIA AS A FASHION, A SOURCE OF BEAUTY, AND THAT SHARE TIPS AND METHODS FOR BECOMING AND REMAINING ANOREXIC. THE 40 MOST-VIEWED VIDEOS (20 INFORMATIVE AND 20 PRO-ANOREXIA VIDEOS) WERE ASSESSED TO GAUGE VIEWER BEHAVIOR. RESULTS: THE INTERRATER AGREEMENT OF CLASSIFICATION WAS MODERATE (FLEISS' KAPPA=0.5), WITH 29.3% (N=41) BEING RATED AS PRO-ANOREXIA, 55.7% (N=78) AS INFORMATIVE, AND 15.0% (N=21) AS OTHERS. PRO-ANOREXIA VIDEOS WERE FAVORED 3 TIMES MORE THAN INFORMATIVE VIDEOS (ODDS RATIO [OR] 3.3, 95% CI 3.3-3.4, P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: PRO-ANOREXIA INFORMATION WAS IDENTIFIED IN 29.3% OF ANOREXIA-RELATED VIDEOS. PRO-ANOREXIA VIDEOS ARE LESS COMMON THAN INFORMATIVE VIDEOS; HOWEVER, IN PROPORTIONAL TERMS, PRO-ANOREXIA CONTENT IS MORE HIGHLY FAVORED AND RATED BY ITS VIEWERS. EFFORTS SHOULD FOCUS ON RAISING AWARENESS, PARTICULARLY AMONG TEENAGERS, ABOUT THE TRUSTWORTHINESS OF ONLINE INFORMATION ABOUT BEAUTY AND HEALTHY LIFESTYLES. HEALTH AUTHORITIES PRODUCING VIDEOS TO COMBAT ANOREXIA SHOULD CONSIDER INVOLVING CELEBRITIES AND MODELS TO REACH A WIDER AUDIENCE. MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO STUDY THE CHARACTERISTICS OF PRO-ANOREXIA VIDEOS IN ORDER TO DEVELOP ALGORITHMS THAT WILL AUTOMATICALLY DETECT AND FILTER THOSE VIDEOS BEFORE THEY BECOME POPULAR.",ANOREXIA NERVOSA; EATING DISORDER; INTERNET; MEDICAL INFORMATICS; ONLINE VIDEOS; SOCIAL NETWORK; YOUTUBE,ADOLESCENT; ADULT; ANOREXIA; ARTICLE; FEMALE; HEALTH BEHAVIOR; HUMAN; INFORMATION DISSEMINATION; INTERPERSONAL COMMUNICATION; PEER GROUP; PSYCHOLOGICAL ASPECT; SOCIAL MEDIA; TELEMEDICINE; VIDEORECORDING; ADOLESCENT; ANOREXIA; COMMUNICATION; FEMALE; HEALTH BEHAVIOR; HUMANS; INFORMATION DISSEMINATION; PEER GROUP; SOCIAL MEDIA; TELEMEDICINE; VIDEO RECORDING; YOUNG ADULT,2013,https://doi.org/10.2196/jmir.2237,6,"2,8,11",1,0,1,CHINA,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
134,FIGHTING MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA USING CROWDSOURCED JUDGMENTS OF NEWS SOURCE QUALITY,"REDUCING THE SPREAD OF MISINFORMATION, ESPECIALLY ON SOCIAL MEDIA, IS A MAJOR CHALLENGE. WE INVESTIGATE ONE POTENTIAL APPROACH: HAVING SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM ALGORITHMS PREFERENTIALLY DISPLAY CONTENT FROM NEWS SOURCES THAT USERS RATE AS TRUSTWORTHY. TO DO SO, WE ASK WHETHER CROWDSOURCED TRUST RATINGS CAN EFFECTIVELY DIFFERENTIATE MORE VERSUS LESS RELIABLE SOURCES. WE RAN TWO PREREGISTERED EXPERIMENTS (N = 1,010 FROM MECHANICAL TURK AND N = 970 FROM LUCID) WHERE INDIVIDUALS RATED FAMILIARITY WITH, AND TRUST IN, 60 NEWS SOURCES FROM THREE CATEGORIES: (I) MAINSTREAM MEDIA OUTLETS, (II) HYPERPARTISAN WEBSITES, AND (III) WEBSITES THAT PRODUCE BLATANTLY FALSE CONTENT (Ã¢â‚¬Å“FAKE NEWSÃ¢â‚¬Â). DESPITE SUBSTANTIAL PARTISAN DIFFERENCES, WE FIND THAT LAYPEOPLE ACROSS THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM RATED MAINSTREAM SOURCES AS FAR MORE TRUSTWORTHY THAN EITHER HYPERPARTISAN OR FAKE NEWS SOURCES. ALTHOUGH THIS DIFFERENCE WAS LARGER FOR DEMOCRATS THAN REPUBLICANSÃ¢â‚¬â€MOSTLY DUE TO DISTRUST OF MAINSTREAM SOURCES BY REPUBLICANSÃ¢â‚¬â€EVERY MAINSTREAM SOURCE (WITH ONE EXCEPTION) WAS RATED AS MORE TRUSTWORTHY THAN EVERY HYPERPARTISAN OR FAKE NEWS SOURCE ACROSS BOTH STUDIES WHEN EQUALLY WEIGHTING RATINGS OF DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS. FURTHERMORE, POLITICALLY BALANCED LAYPERSON RATINGS WERE STRONGLY CORRELATED (R = 0.90) WITH RATINGS PROVIDED BY PROFESSIONAL FACT-CHECKERS. WE ALSO FOUND THAT, PARTICULARLY AMONG LIBERALS, INDIVIDUALS HIGHER IN COGNITIVE REFLECTION WERE BETTER ABLE TO DISCERN BETWEEN LOW- AND HIGH-QUALITY SOURCES. FINALLY, WE FOUND THAT EXCLUDING RATINGS FROM PARTICIPANTS WHO WERE NOT FAMILIAR WITH A GIVEN NEWS SOURCE DRAMATICALLY REDUCED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE CROWD. OUR FINDINGS INDICATE THAT HAVING ALGORITHMS UP-RANK CONTENT FROM TRUSTED MEDIA OUTLETS MAY BE A PROMISING APPROACH FOR FIGHTING THE SPREAD OF MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA.

251,HEALTHPROTECTIVE BEHAVIOUR SOCIAL MEDIA USAGE AND CONSPIRACY BELIEF DURING THE COVID19 PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY,"BACKGROUND SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS HAVE LONG BEEN RECOGNISED AS MAJOR DISSEMINATORS OF HEALTH MISINFORMATION. MANY PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE FOUND A NEGATIVE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN HEALTH-PROTECTIVE BEHAVIOURS AND BELIEF IN THE SPECIFIC FORM OF MISINFORMATION POPULARLY KNOWN AS 'CONSPIRACY THEORY'. CONCERNS HAVE ARISEN REGARDING THE SPREAD OF COVID-19 CONSPIRACY THEORIES ON SOCIAL MEDIA. METHODS THREE QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEYS OF SOCIAL MEDIA USE, CONSPIRACY BELIEFS AND HEALTH-PROTECTIVE BEHAVIOURS WITH REGARD TO COVID-19 AMONG UK RESIDENTS WERE CARRIED OUT ONLINE, ONE USING A SELF-SELECTING SAMPLE (N = 949) AND TWO USING STRATIFIED RANDOM SAMPLES FROM A RECRUITED PANEL (N = 2250, N = 2254). RESULTS ALL THREE STUDIES FOUND A NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COVID-19 CONSPIRACY BELIEFS AND COVID-19 HEALTH-PROTECTIVE BEHAVIOURS, AND A POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COVID-19 CONSPIRACY BELIEFS AND USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA AS A SOURCE OF INFORMATION ABOUT COVID-19. STUDIES 2 AND 3 ALSO FOUND A NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COVID-19 HEALTH-PROTECTIVE BEHAVIOURS AND USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA AS A SOURCE OF INFORMATION, AND STUDY 3 FOUND A POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HEALTH-PROTECTIVE BEHAVIOURS AND USE OF BROADCAST MEDIA AS A SOURCE OF INFORMATION. CONCLUSIONS WHEN USED AS AN INFORMATION SOURCE, UNREGULATED SOCIAL MEDIA MAY PRESENT A HEALTH RISK THAT IS PARTLY BUT NOT WHOLLY REDUCIBLE TO THEIR ROLE AS DISSEMINATORS OF HEALTH-RELATED CONSPIRACY BELIEFS.

SOME DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGNS HAVE BEEN COORDINATED BY MEANS OF BOTS, SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS CONTROLLED BY COMPUTER SCRIPTS THAT TRY TO DISGUISE THEMSELVES AS LEGITIMATE HUMAN USERS. IN THIS STUDY, WE DESCRIBE ONE SUCH OPERATION THAT OCCURRED IN THE RUN UP TO THE 2017 FRENCH PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. WE COLLECTED A MASSIVE TWITTER DATASET OF NEARLY 17 MILLION POSTS THAT APPEARED BETWEEN 27 APRIL AND 7 MAY 2017 (ELECTION DAY). WE THEN SET TO STUDY THE MACRONLEAKS DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN: BY LEVERAGING A MIX OF MACHINE LEARNING AND COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL MODELING TECHNIQUES, WE SEPARATED HUMANS FROM BOTS, AND THEN STUDIED THE ACTIVITIES OF THE TWO GROUPS INDEPENDENTLY, AS WELL AS THEIR INTERPLAY. WE PROVIDE A CHARACTERIZATION OF BOTH THE BOTS AND THE USERS WHO ENGAGED WITH THEM, AND OPPOSE IT TO THOSE USERS WHO DIDN'T. PRIOR INTERESTS OF DISINFORMATION ADOPTERS PINPOINT TO THE REASONS OF SCARCE SUCCESS OF THIS CAMPAIGN: THE USERS WHO ENGAGED WITH MACRONLEAKS ARE MOSTLY FOREIGNERS WITH PRE-EXISTING INTEREST IN ALT-RIGHT TOPICS AND ALTERNATIVE NEWS MEDIA, RATHER THAN FRENCH USERS WITH DIVERSE POLITICAL VIEWS.

RESEARCH SHOWS THAT, IN SOCIAL MEDIA, FALSEHOOD IS SHARED FAR MORE THAN EVIDENCE-BASED INFORMATION. HOWEVER, THERE IS LESS RESEARCH ANALYZING THE CIRCULATION OF FALSE AND EVIDENCE-BASED INFORMATION DURING HEALTH EMERGENCIES.

TO THAT END, 1000 TWEETS HAVE BEEN ANALYZED. RESULTS SHOW THAT FALSE INFORMATION IS TWEETED MORE BUT RETWEETED LESS THAN SCIENCE-BASED EVIDENCE OR FACT-CHECKING TWEETS, WHILE SCIENCE-BASED EVIDENCE AND FACT-CHECKING TWEETS CAPTURE MORE ENGAGEMENT THAN MERE FACTS.

484,YOUTUBE AS A SOURCE OF INFORMATION ON COVID19 A PANDEMIC OF MISINFORMATION,"INTRODUCTION THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IS THIS CENTURY'S LARGEST PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY AND ITS SUCCESSFUL MANAGEMENT RELIES ON THE EFFECTIVE DISSEMINATION OF FACTUAL INFORMATION. AS A SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM WITH BILLIONS OF DAILY VIEWS, YOUTUBE HAS TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL TO BOTH SUPPORT AND HINDER PUBLIC HEALTH EFFORTS. HOWEVER, THE USEFULNESS AND ACCURACY OF MOST VIEWED YOUTUBE VIDEOS ON COVID-19 HAVE NOT BEEN INVESTIGATED. METHODS A YOUTUBE SEARCH WAS PERFORMED ON 21 MARCH 2020 USING KEYWORDS Ã¢â€šÂ¬ CORONAVIRUS' AND Ã¢â€šÂ¬ COVID-19', AND THE TOP 75 VIEWED VIDEOS FROM EACH SEARCH WERE ANALYSED. VIDEOS THAT WERE DUPLICATES, NON-ENGLISH, NON-AUDIO AND NON-VISUAL, EXCEEDING 1 HOUR IN DURATION, LIVE AND UNRELATED TO COVID-19 WERE EXCLUDED. TWO REVIEWERS CODED THE SOURCE, CONTENT AND CHARACTERISTICS OF INCLUDED VIDEOS. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS USABILITY AND RELIABILITY OF VIDEOS, ANALYSED USING THE NOVEL COVID-19 SPECIFIC SCORE (CSS), MODIFIED DISCERN (MDISCERN) AND MODIFIED JAMA (MJAMA) SCORES. RESULTS OF 150 VIDEOS SCREENED, 69 (46%) WERE INCLUDED, TOTALLING 257 804 146 VIEWS. NINETEEN (27.5%) VIDEOS CONTAINED NON-FACTUAL INFORMATION, TOTALLING 62 042 609 VIEWS.

HOWEVER, THEY ONLY ACCOUNTED FOR 11% OF VIDEOS AND 10% OF VIEWS. CONCLUSION OVER ONE-QUARTER OF THE MOST VIEWED YOUTUBE VIDEOS ON COVID-19 CONTAINED MISLEADING INFORMATION, REACHING MILLIONS OF VIEWERS WORLDWIDE. AS THE CURRENT COVID-19 PANDEMIC WORSENS, PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCIES MUST BETTER USE YOUTUBE TO DELIVER TIMELY AND ACCURATE INFORMATION AND TO MINIMISE THE SPREAD OF MISINFORMATION. THIS MAY PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN SUCCESSFULLY MANAGING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. Ã‚Â© Ã‚Â© AUTHOR(S) (OR THEIR EMPLOYER(S)) 2020. RE-USE PERMITTED UNDER CC BY-NC. NO COMMERCIAL RE-USE.

446,SOCIAL MEDIA AND VACCINE HESITANCY,"BACKGROUND UNDERSTANDING THE THREAT POSED BY ANTI-VACCINATION EFFORTS ON SOCIAL MEDIA IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT WITH THE FORTH COMING NEED FOR WORLD WIDE COVID-19 VACCINATION PROGRAMS. WE GLOBALLY EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF SOCIAL MEDIA AND ONLINE FOREIGN DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGNS ON VACCINATION RATES AND ATTITUDES TOWARDS VACCINE SAFETY. METHODS WEUSE A LARGE-N CROSS-COUNTRY REGRESSION FRAMEWORK TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OFSOCIAL MEDIA ON VACCINE HESITANCY GLOBALLY. TO DO SO, WE OPERATIONALIZE SOCIAL MEDIA USAGE IN TWO DIMENSIONS: THE USE OF IT BY THE PUBLIC TO ORGANIZE ACTION(USING DIGITAL SOCIETY PROJECT INDICATORS), AND THE LEVEL OF NEGATIVE LYORIENTED DISCOURSE ABOUT VACCINES ON SOCIAL MEDIA (USING A DATA SET OF ALL GEOCODED TWEETS IN THE WORLD FROM 2018-2019). IN ADDITION, WE MEASURE THE LEVEL OF FOREIGN-SOURCED COORDINATED DISINFORMATION OPERATIONS ON SOCIAL MEDIA INEACH COUNTRY (USING DIGITAL SOCIETY PROJECT INDICATORS). THE OUTCOME OF VACCINE HESITANCY IS MEASURED IN TWO WAYS. FIRST, WE USE POLLS OF WHAT PROPORTION OFTHE PUBLIC PER COUNTRY FEELS VACCINES ARE UNSAFE (USING WELLCOME GLOBAL MONITOR INDICATORS FOR 137 COUNTRIES). SECOND, WE USE ANNUAL DATA OF ACTUAL VACCINATION RATES FROM THE WHO FOR 166 COUNTRIES. RESULTS WE FOUND THE USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA TO ORGANISE OFFLINE ACTION TO BE HIGHLY PREDICTIVE OF THE BELIEF THAT VACCINATIONS ARE UNSAFE, WITH SUCH BELIEFS MOUNTING AS MORE ORGANISATION OCCURS ON SOCIAL MEDIA. IN ADDITION, THE PREVALENCE OF FOREIGN DISINFORMATION IS HIGHLY STATISTICALLY AND SUBSTANTIVELY SIGNIFICANT IN PREDICTING A DROP IN MEAN VACCINATION COVERAGE OVER TIME. A 1-POINT SHIFT UPWARDS IN THE 5-POINT DISINFORMATION SCALE IS ASSOCIATED WITH A 2-PERCENTAGE POINT DROP IN MEAN VACCINATION COVERAGE YEAR OVER YEAR. WE ALSO FOUND SUPPORT FOR THE CONNECTION OF FOREIGN DISINFORMATION WITH NEGATIVE SOCIAL MEDIA ACTIVITY ABOUT VACCINATION. THE SUBSTANTIVE EFFECT OF FOREIGN DISINFORMATION IS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF NEGATIVE VACCINE TWEETS BY 15% FOR THE MEDIAN COUNTRY. CONCLUSION THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ORGANISATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND PUBLIC DOUBTS OF VACCINE SAFETY. IN ADDITION, THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FOREIGN DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGNS AND DECLINING VACCINATION COVERAGE. Ã‚Â© 2020 BMJ PUBLISHING GROUP.

USING AN EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN, OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT WHILE A SINGLE CORRECTION FROM ANOTHER USER DID NOT REDUCE MISPERCEPTIONS, THE CDC ON ITS OWN COULD CORRECT MISINFORMATION. CORRECTIONS WERE MORE EFFECTIVE AMONG THOSE HIGHER IN INITIAL MISPERCEPTIONS. NOTABLY, ORGANIZATIONAL CREDIBILITY WAS NOT REDUCED WHEN CORRECTING MISINFORMATION, MAKING THIS A LOW-COST BEHAVIOR FOR PUBLIC HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS.

141,TRENDS IN THE DIFFUSION OF MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA,"IN RECENT YEARS, THERE HAS BEEN WIDESPREAD CONCERN THAT MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA IS DAMAGING SOCIETIES AND DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS. IN RESPONSE, SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS HAVE ANNOUNCED ACTIONS TO LIMIT THE SPREAD OF FALSE CONTENT. WE MEASURE TRENDS IN THE DIFFUSION OF CONTENT FROM 569 FAKE NEWS WEBSITES AND 9540 FAKE NEWS STORIES ON FACEBOOK AND TWITTER BETWEEN JANUARY 2015 AND JULY 2018. USER INTERACTIONS WITH FALSE CONTENT ROSE STEADILY ON BOTH FACEBOOK AND TWITTER THROUGH THE END OF 2016. SINCE THEN, HOWEVER, INTERACTIONS WITH FALSE CONTENT HAVE FALLEN SHARPLY ON FACEBOOK WHILE CONTINUING TO RISE ON TWITTER, WITH THE RATIO OF FACEBOOK ENGAGEMENTS TO TWITTER SHARES DECREASING BY 60%. IN COMPARISON, INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER NEWS, BUSINESS, OR CULTURE SITES HAVE FOLLOWED SIMILAR TRENDS ON BOTH PLATFORMS. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE RELATIVE MAGNITUDE OF THE MISINFORMATION PROBLEM ON FACEBOOK HAS DECLINED SINCE ITS PEAK.

93,THE SPREAD OF MEDICAL FAKE NEWS IN SOCIAL MEDIA THE PILOT QUANTITATIVE STUDY,"OBJECTIVES: FAKE NEWS: MISINFORMATION AND FALSEHOOD OF HEALTH NEWS IN SOCIAL MEDIA CONSTITUTE A POTENTIAL THREAT TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH, BUT THE SCOPE OF THIS ISSUE REMAINS UNCLEAR. OUR PILOT STUDY IS AN INITIAL ATTEMPT TO MEASURE A NUMBER OF THE TOP SHARED HEALTH MISINFORMATION STORIES IN THE POLISH LANGUAGE SOCIAL MEDIA. METHODS: USING THE BUZZSUMO APPLICATION, A RANGE OF THE TOP SHARED HEALTH WEB LINKS IN THE POLISH LANGUAGE SOCIAL MEDIA WAS ASSESSED DURING THE PERIOD BETWEEN 2012 AND 2017. WE USED THE FOLLOWING KEYWORDS WHICH WERE RELATED TO THE MOST COMMON DISEASES AND CAUSES OF DEATH: CANCER, NEOPLASM, HEART ATTACK, STROKE, HYPERTENSION, DIABETES, VACCINATIONS, HIV, AND AIDS. EACH LINK WAS CHECKED FOR THE PRESENCE OF FAKE NEWS. RESULTS: 40% OF THE MOST FREQUENTLY SHARED LINKS CONTAINED TEXT WE CLASSIFIED AS FAKE NEWS. THESE WERE SHARED MORE THAN 450,000 TIMES. THE MOST FALLACIOUS CONTENT CONCERNED VACCINES, WHILE NEWS ABOUT CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES WAS, IN GENERAL, WELL SOURCED AND INFORMATIVE. MORE THAN 20% OF DANGEROUS LINKS FROM OUR MATERIAL WAS GENERATED BY ONE SOURCE. CONCLUSIONS: ANALYZING SOCIAL MEDIA TOP SHARED NEWS COULD CONTRIBUTE TO IDENTIFICATION OF LEADING FAKE MEDICAL INFORMATION MISEDUCATING THE SOCIETY.

A LARGE CROSS-SECTIONAL DATA FROM 1022 SOCIAL MEDIA USERS ARE COLLECTED TO TEST THE RESEARCH MODEL, FORMULATED USING SOCIAL COMPARISON THEORY, SELF-DETERMINATION THEORY, RATIONAL CHOICE THEORY AND SEMINAL WORK ON PSYCHOLOGY AND COMMUNICATION. THE STUDY RESULTS SUGGEST THAT ONLINE TRUST, SELF-DISCLOSURE, FEAR OF MISSING OUT (FOMO), AND SOCIAL MEDIA FATIGUE ARE POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE SHARING FAKE NEWS (INTENTIONALLY). IN CONTRAST, SOCIAL COMPARISON HAS A NEGATIVE ASSOCIATION. THE STUDY FINDINGS ALSO INDICATE THAT ONLINE TRUST HAS NEGATIVE ASSOCIATION WITH AUTHENTICATING NEWS BEFORE SHARING.

WE TRACED THE LIFECYCLE OF 17 POPULAR POLITICAL RUMORS THAT CIRCULATED ON TWITTER OVER 13 MONTHS DURING THE 2012 U.S. PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. USING TEXT ANALYSIS BASED ON TIME SERIES, WE FOUND THAT WHILE FALSE RUMORS (MISINFORMATION) TEND TO COME BACK MULTIPLE TIMES AFTER THE INITIAL PUBLICATION, TRUE RUMORS (FACTS) DO NOT. RUMOR RESURGENCE CONTINUES, OFTEN ACCOMPANYING TEXTUAL CHANGES, UNTIL THE TENSION AROUND THE TARGET DISSOLVES. WE OBSERVED THAT RUMORS RESURFACE BY PARTISAN NEWS WEBSITES THAT REPACKAGE THE OLD RUMOR INTO NEWS AND, GAIN VISIBILITY BY INFLUENTIAL TWITTER USERS WHO INTRODUCE SUCH RUMOR INTO THE TWITTERSPHERE.

91,ANATOMY OF AN ONLINE MISINFORMATION NETWORK,"MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF FAKE NEWS AND CONSPIRATORIAL CONTENT HAVE SPREAD OVER SOCIAL MEDIA BEFORE AND AFTER THE 2016 US PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS DESPITE INTENSE FACT-CHECKING EFFORTS. HOW DO THE SPREAD OF MISINFORMATION AND FACT-CHECKING COMPETE? WHAT ARE THE STRUCTURAL AND DYNAMIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE CORE OF THE MISINFORMATION DIFFUSION NETWORK, AND WHO ARE ITS MAIN PURVEYORS? HOW TO REDUCE THE OVERALL AMOUNT OF MISINFORMATION? TO EXPLORE THESE QUESTIONS WE BUILT HOAXY, AN OPEN PLATFORM THAT ENABLES LARGE-SCALE, SYSTEMATIC STUDIES OF HOW MISINFORMATION AND FACT-CHECKING SPREAD AND COMPETE ON TWITTER. HOAXY CAPTURES PUBLIC TWEETS THAT INCLUDE LINKS TO ARTICLES FROM LOW-CREDIBILITY AND FACT-CHECKING SOURCES. WE PERFORM K-CORE DECOMPOSITION ON A DIFFUSION NETWORK OBTAINED FROM TWO MILLION RETWEETS PRODUCED BY SEVERAL HUNDRED THOUSAND ACCOUNTS OVER THE SIX MONTHS BEFORE THE ELECTION. AS WE MOVE FROM THE PERIPHERY TO THE CORE OF THE NETWORK, FACT-CHECKING NEARLY DISAPPEARS, WHILE SOCIAL BOTS PROLIFERATE. THE NUMBER OF USERS IN THE MAIN CORE REACHES EQUILIBRIUM AROUND THE TIME OF THE ELECTION, WITH LIMITED CHURN AND INCREASINGLY DENSE CONNECTIONS. WE CONCLUDE BY QUANTIFYING HOW EFFECTIVELY THE NETWORK CAN BE DISRUPTED BY PENALIZING THE MOST CENTRAL NODES.

62,DEBUNKING IN A WORLD OF TRIBES,"SOCIAL MEDIA AGGREGATE PEOPLE AROUND COMMON INTERESTS ELICITING COLLECTIVE FRAMING OF NARRATIVES AND WORLDVIEWS. HOWEVER, IN SUCH A DISINTERMEDIATED ENVIRONMENT MISINFORMATION IS PERVASIVE AND ATTEMPTS TO DEBUNK ARE OFTEN UNDERTAKEN TO CONTRAST THIS TREND. IN THIS WORK, WE EXAMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DEBUNKING ON FACEBOOK THROUGH A QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF 54 MILLION USERS OVER A TIME SPAN OF FIVE YEARS (JAN 2010, DEC 2014). IN PARTICULAR, WE COMPARE HOW USERS USUALLY CONSUMING PROVEN (SCIENTIFIC) AND UNSUBSTANTIATED (CONSPIRACY-LIKE) INFORMATION ON FACEBOOK US INTERACT WITH SPECIFIC DEBUNKING POSTS. OUR FINDINGS CONFIRM THE EXISTENCE OF ECHO CHAMBERS WHERE USERS INTERACT PRIMARILY WITH EITHER CONSPIRACY-LIKE OR SCIENTIFIC PAGES. HOWEVER, BOTH GROUPS INTERACT SIMILARLY WITH THE INFORMATION WITHIN THEIR ECHO CHAMBER. THEN, WE MEASURE HOW USERS FROM BOTH ECHO CHAMBERS INTERACTED WITH 50,220 DEBUNKING POSTS ACCOUNTING FOR BOTH USERS CONSUMPTION PATTERNS AND THE SENTIMENT EXPRESSED IN THEIR COMMENTS. SENTIMENT ANALYSIS REVEALS A DOMINANT NEGATIVITY IN THE COMMENTS TO DEBUNKING POSTS. FURTHERMORE, SUCH POSTS REMAIN MAINLY CONFINED TO THE SCIENTIFIC ECHO CHAMBER. ONLY FEW CONSPIRACY USERS ENGAGE WITH CORRECTIONS AND THEIR LIKING AND COMMENTING RATES ON CONSPIRACY POSTS INCREASES AFTER THE INTERACTION. Ã‚Â© 2017 ZOLLO ET AL.

144,DISSEMINATION OF MISINFORMATIVE AND BIASED INFORMATION ABOUT PROSTATE CANCER ON YOUTUBE,"YOUTUBE IS A SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM WITH MORE THAN 1 BILLION USERS AND >600 000 VIDEOS ABOUT PROSTATE CANCER. TWO SMALL STUDIES EXAMINED THE QUALITY OF PROSTATE CANCER VIDEOS ON YOUTUBE, BUT DID NOT USE VALIDATED INSTRUMENTS, EXAMINE USER INTERACTIONS, OR CHARACTERIZE THE SPREAD OF MISINFORMATION. WE PERFORMED THE LARGEST, MOST COMPREHENSIVE EXAMINATION OF PROSTATE CANCER INFORMATION ON YOUTUBE TO DATE, INCLUDING THE FIRST 150 VIDEOS ON SCREENING AND TREATMENT. WE USED THE VALIDATED DISCERN QUALITY CRITERIA FOR CONSUMER HEALTH INFORMATION AND THE PATIENT EDUCATION MATERIALS ASSESSMENT TOOL, AND COMPARED RESULTS FOR USER ENGAGEMENT. THE VIDEOS IN OUR SAMPLE HAD UP TO 1.3 MILLION VIEWS (AVERAGE 45 223) AND THE OVERALL QUALITY OF INFORMATION WAS MODERATE. MORE VIDEOS DESCRIBED BENEFITS (75%) THAN HARMS (53%), AND ONLY 50% PROMOTED SHARED DECISION-MAKING AS RECOMMENDED IN CURRENT GUIDELINES. ONLY 54% OF THE VIDEOS DEFINED MEDICAL TERMS AND FEW PROVIDED SUMMARIES OR REFERENCES. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN SCIENTIFIC QUALITY AND VIEWER ENGAGEMENT (VIEWS/MONTH P = 0.004; THUMBS UP/VIEWS P = 0.015). THE COMMENTS SECTION UNDERNEATH SOME VIDEOS CONTAINED ADVERTISING AND PEER-TO-PEER MEDICAL ADVICE. A TOTAL OF 115 VIDEOS (77%) CONTAINED POTENTIALLY MISINFORMATIVE AND/OR BIASED CONTENT WITHIN THE VIDEO OR COMMENTS SECTION, WITH A TOTAL REACH OF >6 MILLION VIEWERS. PATIENT SUMMARY: MANY POPULAR YOUTUBE VIDEOS ABOUT PROSTATE CANCER CONTAINED BIASED OR POOR-QUALITY INFORMATION. A GREATER NUMBER OF VIEWS AND THUMBS UP ON YOUTUBE DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE INFORMATION IS TRUSTWORTHY. MANY OF THE TOP YOUTUBE VIDEOS ON PROSTATE CANCER CONTAIN BIASED OR MISINFORMATIVE CONTENT.

GUIDED BY THE USES AND GRATIFICATIONS APPROACH AND RUMOR RESEARCH, UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS IN SINGAPORE WERE SURVEYED ON WHY THEY SHARE MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA. GENDER AND STUDY-LEVEL DIFFERENCES WERE INVESTIGATED. OVER 60% OF RESPONDENTS HAD SHARED MISINFORMATION. THE TOP REASONS WERE RELATED TO THE INFORMATION'S PERCEIVED CHARACTERISTICS, AS WELL AS SELF-EXPRESSION AND SOCIALIZING. ACCURACY AND AUTHORITATIVENESS DID NOT RANK HIGHLY.

THE FORMER SHARE (AND INTEND TO SHARE) MORE MISINFORMATION THAN THE LATTER, BUT THE DIFFERENCE WAS NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. BECAUSE MANY OF THE REASONS CITED WERE SOCIAL IN NATURE, IL TRAINING SHOULD ADDRESS THE SOCIAL MOTIVATIONS PROPELLING SUCH BEHAVIOR.

AS INFECTIONS STARTED TO RISE, RELIABLE INFORMATION QUICKLY BECAME MORE DOMINANT, AND TWITTER CONTENT SHIFTED TOWARDS MORE CREDIBLE INFORMATIONAL SOURCES.

IN PARTICULAR, WE STUDY ONE RUMOR THAT APPEARED IN THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH OF THE GREAT EAST JAPAN EARTHQUAKE ON MARCH 11, 2011, WHICH LATER TURNED OUT TO BE MISINFORMATION. BY INVESTIGATING WHOLE JAPANESE TWEETS THAT WERE SENT ONE WEEK AFTER THE QUAKE, WE SHOW THAT ONE CORRECTION TWEET, WHICH ORIGINATED FROM A CITY HALL ACCOUNT, DIFFUSED ENORMOUSLY. WE ALSO DEMONSTRATE A STOCHASTIC AGENTBASED MODEL, WHICH IS INSPIRED BY CONTAGION MODEL OF EPIDEMICS SIR, CAN REPRODUCE OBSERVED RUMOR DYNAMICS. OUR MODEL CAN ESTIMATE THE RUMOR INFECTION RATE AS WELL AS THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO STILL BELIEVE IN THE RUMOR THAT CANNOT BE OBSERVED DIRECTLY. FOR APPLICATIONS, RUMOR DIFFUSION SIZES CAN BE ESTIMATED IN VARIOUS SCENARIOS BY COMBINING OUR MODEL WITH THE REAL DATA.

124,SAYS WHO THE EFFECTS OF PRESENTATION FORMAT AND SOURCE RATING ON FAKE NEWS IN SOCIAL MEDIA,"NEWSÃ¢â‚¬â€REAL OR FAKEÃ¢â‚¬â€IS NOW ABUNDANT ON SOCIAL MEDIA. NEWS POSTS ON SOCIAL MEDIA FOCUS USERSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ ATTENTION ON THE HEADLINES, BUT DOES IT MATTER WHO WROTE THE ARTICLE? WE INVESTIGATE WHETHER CHANGING THE PRESENTATION FORMAT TO HIGHLIGHT THE SOURCE OF THE ARTICLE AFFECTS ITS BELIEVABILITY AND HOW SOCIAL MEDIA USERS CHOOSE TO ENGAGE WITH IT. WE CONDUCTED TWO EXPERIMENTS AND FOUND THAT NUDGING USERS TO THINK ABOUT WHO WROTE THE ARTICLE INFLUENCED THE EXTENT TO WHICH THEY BELIEVED IT. THE PRESENTATION FORMAT OF HIGHLIGHTING THE SOURCE HAD A MAIN EFFECT; IT MADE USERS MORE SKEPTICAL OF ALL ARTICLES, REGARDLESS OF THE SOURCEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S CREDIBILITY. FOR UNKNOWN SOURCES, LOW SOURCE RATINGS HAD A DIRECT EFFECT ON BELIEVABILITY. BELIEVABILITY, IN TURN, INFLUENCED THE EXTENT TO WHICH USERS WOULD ENGAGE WITH THE ARTICLE (E.G., READ, LIKE, COMMENT, AND SHARE). WE ALSO FOUND CONFIRMATION BIAS TO BE RAMPANT: USERS WERE MORE LIKELY TO BELIEVE ARTICLES THAT ALIGNED WITH THEIR BELIEFS, OVER AND ABOVE THE EFFECTS OF OTHER FACTORS.

DRAWING UPON RESEARCH ON THE STIMULUS-RESPONSE THEORY (HYPODERMIC NEEDLE THEORY) AND THE RESILIENCE THEORY, THIS STUDY TESTED A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK CONSIDERING GENERAL MISINFORMATION BELIEF, CONSPIRACY BELIEF, AND RELIGIOUS MISINFORMATION BELIEF AS THE STIMULUS; AND CREDIBILITY EVALUATIONS AS RESILIENCE STRATEGY; AND THEIR EFFECTS ON COVID-19 INDIVIDUAL RESPONSES. USING A SELF-ADMINISTERED ONLINE SURVEY DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, THE STUDY OBTAINED 483 USEABLE RESPONSES AND AFTER TEST, FINDS THAT ALL-INCLUSIVE, THE PROPAGATION OF MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA UNDERMINES THE COVID-19 INDIVIDUAL RESPONSES. PARTICULARLY, CREDIBILITY EVALUATION OF MISINFORMATION STRONGLY PREDICTS THE COVID-19 INDIVIDUAL RESPONSES WITH POSITIVE INFLUENCES AND RELIGIOUS MISINFORMATION BELIEFS AS WELL AS CONSPIRACY BELIEFS AND GENERAL MISINFORMATION BELIEFS COME NEXT AND INFLUENCE NEGATIVELY.

35,SOCIAL MEDIAS INITIAL REACTION TO INFORMATION AND MISINFORMATION ON EBOLA AUGUST 2014 FACTS AND RUMORS,"OBJECTIVE. WE ANALYZED MISINFORMATION ABOUT EBOLA CIRCULATING ON TWITTER AND SINA WEIBO, THE LEADING CHINESE MICROBLOG PLATFORM, AT THE OUTSET OF THE GLOBAL RESPONSE TO THE 2014Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2015 EBOLA EPIDEMIC TO HELP PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCIES DEVELOP THEIR SOCIAL MEDIA COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES. METHODS. WE RETRIEVED TWITTER AND SINA WEIBO DATA CREATED WITHIN 24 HOURS OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION ANNOUNCEMENT OF A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY OF INTERNATIONAL CONCERN (BATCH 1 FROM AUGUST 8, 2014, 06:50:00 GREENWICH MEAN TIME [GMT] TO AUGUST 9, 2014, 06:49:59 GMT) AND SEVEN DAYS LATER (BATCH 2 FROM AUGUST 15, 2014, 06:50:00 GMT TO AUGUST 16, 2014, 06:49:59 GMT). WE OBTAINED AND ANALYZED A 1% RANDOM SAMPLE OF TWEETS CONTAINING THE KEYWORD EBOLA. WE RETRIEVED ALL SINA WEIBO POSTS WITH CHINESE KEYWORDS FOR EBOLA FOR ANALYSIS. WE ANALYZED CHANGES IN FREQUENCIES OF KEYWORDS, HASHTAGS, AND WEB LINKS USING RELATIVE RISK (RR) AND <U+03A7>2 FEATURE SELECTION ALGORITHM. WE IDENTIFIED MISINFORMATION BY MANUAL CODING AND CATEGORIZING RANDOMLY SELECTED SUB-DATASETS. RESULTS. WE IDENTIFIED TWO SPECULATIVE TREATMENTS (I.E., BATHING IN OR DRINKING SALTWATER AND INGESTION OF NANO SILVER, AN EXPERIMENTAL DRUG) IN OUR ANALYSIS OF CHANGES IN FREQUENCIES OF KEYWORDS AND HASHTAGS. SALTWATER WAS SPECULATED TO BE PROTECTIVE AGAINST EBOLA IN BATCH 1 TWEETS BUT THEIR MENTIONS DECREASED IN BATCH 2 (RR=0.11 FOR Ã¢â‚¬Å“SALTÃ¢â‚¬Â AND RR=0.14 FOR Ã¢â‚¬Å“WATERÃ¢â‚¬Â). NANO SILVER MENTIONS WERE HIGHER IN BATCH 2 THAN IN BATCH 1 (RR=https://doi.org/10.5). IN OUR MANUALLY CODED SAMPLES, EBOLA-RELATED MISINFORMATION CONSTITUTED ABOUT 2% OF TWITTER AND SINA WEIBO CONTENT. A RANGE OF 36%Ã¢â‚¬â€œ58% OF THE POSTS WERE NEWS ABOUT THE EBOLA OUTBREAK AND 19%Ã¢â‚¬â€œ24% OF THE POSTS WERE HEALTH INFORMATION AND RESPONSES TO MISINFORMATION IN BOTH BATCHES. IN BATCH 2, 43% OF CHINESE MICROBLOGS FOCUSED ON THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT SENDING MEDICAL ASSISTANCE TO GUINEA. CONCLUSION. MISINFORMATION ABOUT EBOLA WAS CIRCULATED AT A VERY LOW LEVEL GLOBALLY IN SOCIAL MEDIA IN EITHER BATCH.

69,DISTRESS AND RUMOR EXPOSURE ON SOCIAL MEDIA DURING A CAMPUS LOCKDOWN,"DURING CRISIS EVENTS, PEOPLE OFTEN SEEK OUT EVENT-RELATED INFORMATION TO STAY INFORMED OF WHAT IS HAPPENING. HOWEVER, WHEN INFORMATION FROM OFFICIAL CHANNELS IS LACKING OR DISSEMINATED IRREGULARLY, PEOPLE MAY BE AT RISK FOR EXPOSURE TO RUMORS THAT FILL THE INFORMATION VOID. WE STUDIED INFORMATION-SEEKING DURING A UNIVERSITY LOCKDOWN FOLLOWING AN ACTIVE-SHOOTER EVENT. IN STUDY 1, STUDENTS IN THE LOCKDOWN (N = 3,890) COMPLETED ANONYMOUS SURVEYS 1 WEEK LATER. THOSE WHO INDICATED RECEIVING CONFLICTING INFORMATION ABOUT THE LOCKDOWN REPORTED GREATER ACUTE STRESS [STANDARDIZED REGRESSION COEFFICIENT (B) = 0.07; SE = 0.01; 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI), 0.04, 0.10]. ADDITIONALLY, THOSE WHO REPORTED DIRECT CONTACT WITH CLOSE OTHERS VIA TEXT MESSAGE (OR PHONE) AND USED TWITTER FOR CRITICAL UPDATES DURING THE LOCKDOWN WERE EXPOSED TO MORE CONFLICTING INFORMATION. HIGHER ACUTE STRESS WAS REPORTED BY HEAVY SOCIAL MEDIA USERS WHO TRUSTED SOCIAL MEDIA FOR CRITICAL UPDATES (B = 0.06, SE = 0.01; 95% CI, 0.03, 0.10). IN STUDY 2, WE EMPLOYED A BIG DATA APPROACH TO EXPLORE THE TIME COURSE OF RUMOR TRANSMISSION ACROSS 5 HOURS SURROUNDING THE LOCKDOWN WITHIN A SUBSET OF THE UNIVERSITYÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S TWITTER FOLLOWERS. WE ALSO EXAMINED THE PATTERNING OF DISTRESS IN THE HOURS DURING THE LOCKDOWN AS RUMORS ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING (E.G., PRESENCE OF MULTIPLE SHOOTERS) SPREAD AMONG TWITTER USERS. DURING PERIODS WITHOUT UPDATES FROM OFFICIAL CHANNELS, RUMORS AND DISTRESS INCREASED. RESULTS HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF RELEASING SUBSTANTIVE UPDATES AT REGULAR INTERVALS DURING A CRISIS EVENT AND MONITORING SOCIAL MEDIA FOR RUMORS TO MITIGATE RUMOR EXPOSURE AND DISTRESS.

41,A COMPARISON OF LANGUAGE USE IN PRO AND ANTIVACCINATION COMMENTS IN RESPONSE TO A HIGH PROFILE FACEBOOK POST,"BACKGROUND VACCINATIONS ARE IMPORTANT FOR CONTROLLING THE SPREAD OF DISEASE, YET AN INCREASING NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARE DISTRUSTFUL OF VACCINES, AND CHOOSE NOT TO (FULLY) VACCINATE THEMSELVES AND THEIR CHILDREN. ONE PROPOSED CONTRIBUTOR TO THIS DISTRUST IS ANTI-VACCINATION MISINFORMATION AVAILABLE ON THE INTERNET, WHERE PEOPLE SEARCH FOR AND DISCUSS HEALTH INFORMATION. THE LANGUAGE PEOPLE USE IN THESE DISCUSSIONS CAN PROVIDE INSIGHTS INTO VIEWS ABOUT VACCINATION. METHODS FOLLOWING A PROMINENT FACEBOOK POST ABOUT CHILDHOOD VACCINATION, LANGUAGE USED BY PARTICIPANTS IN A COMMENT THREAD WAS ANALYSED USING LIWC (LINGUISTIC INQUIRY AND WORD COUNT). PERCENTAGE OF WORDS USED ACROSS A NUMBER OF CATEGORIES WAS COMPARED BETWEEN PRO-VACCINATION, ANTI-VACCINATION, AND UNRELATED (CONTROL) COMMENTS. RESULTS BOTH PRO- AND ANTI-VACCINATION COMMENTS USED MORE RISK-RELATED AND CAUSATION WORDS, AS WELL AS FEWER POSITIVE EMOTION WORDS COMPARED TO CONTROL COMMENTS. ANTI-VACCINE COMMENTS WERE TYPIFIED BY GREATER ANALYTICAL THINKING, LOWER AUTHENTICITY, MORE BODY AND HEALTH REFERENCES, AND A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF WORK-RELATED WORD USE IN COMPARISON TO PRO-VACCINE COMMENTS, PLUS MORE MONEY REFERENCES THAN CONTROL COMMENTS. IN CONTRAST, PRO-VACCINATION COMMENTS WERE MORE AUTHENTIC, SOMEWHAT MORE TENTATIVE, AND EVIDENCED HIGHER ANXIETY WORDS, AS WELL AS MORE REFERENCES TO FAMILY AND SOCIAL PROCESSES WHEN COMPARED TO ANTI-VACCINATION COMMENTS. CONCLUSION ALTHOUGH THE ANTI-VACCINATION STANCE IS NOT SCIENTIFICALLY-BASED, COMMENTS SHOWED EVIDENCE OF GREATER ANALYTICAL THINKING, AND MORE REFERENCES TO HEALTH AND THE BODY. IN CONTRAST, PRO-VACCINATION COMMENTS DEMONSTRATED GREATER COMPARATIVE ANXIETY, WITH A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON FAMILY AND SOCIAL PROCESSES. THESE RESULTS MAY BE INDICATIVE OF THE RELATIVE SALIENCE OF THESE ISSUES AND EMOTIONS IN DIFFERING UNDERSTANDINGS OF THE BENEFITS AND RISKS OF VACCINATION. TEXT-BASED ANALYSIS IS A POTENTIALLY USEFUL AND ECOLOGICALLY VALID TOOL FOR ASSESSING PERCEPTIONS OF HEALTH ISSUES, AND MAY PROVIDE UNIQUE INFORMATION ABOUT PARTICULAR CONCERNS OR ARGUMENTS EXPRESSED ON SOCIAL MEDIA THAT COULD INFORM FUTURE INTERVENTIONS.

IN THIS PAPER, WE ANALYZE FAKE NEWS AS GENRE BLENDING, COMBINING ELEMENTS OF TRADITIONAL NEWS WITH FEATURES THAT ARE EXOGENOUS TO NORMATIVE PROFESSIONAL JOURNALISM: MISINFORMATION, SENSATIONALISM, CLICKBAIT, AND BIAS. THROUGH A CONTENT ANALYSIS OF STORIES PUBLISHED BY 50 SITES THAT HAVE BEEN LABELED FAKE NEWS AND THE ENGAGEMENT THEY GENERATED ON SOCIAL MEDIA, WE FOUND THAT STORIES EMPLOYED MODERATE LEVELS OF SENSATIONALISM, MISINFORMATION AND PARTISANSHIP TO PROVIDE ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT NARRATIVES. COMPLETE FABRICATIONS WERE UNCOMMON AND DID NOT RESONATE WELL WITH AUDIENCES, ALTHOUGH THERE WAS SOME TRUTH-STRETCHING THAT CAME WITH GENRE BLENDING. RESULTS SUGGEST THAT TECHNOCENTRIC SOLUTIONS AIMED AT DETECTING FALSEHOODS ARE LIKELY INSUFFICIENT, AS FAKE NEWS IS DEFINED MORE BY PARTISANSHIP AND IDENTITY POLITICS THAN MISINFORMATION AND DECEPTION.

36,AN EXPLORATION OF RUMOR COMBATING BEHAVIOR ON SOCIAL MEDIA IN THE CONTEXT OF SOCIAL CRISES,"THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE FORMATION OF SOCIAL MEDIA USERS' RUMOR COMBATING BEHAVIOR DURING CRISES BY MERGING THE THEORY OF PLANNED BEHAVIOR AND THE NORM ACTIVATION MODEL INTO ONE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK. BASED ON A SAMPLE OF 394 SOCIAL MEDIA USERS, THE DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICAL ANALYSIS SHOWED TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF GAPS. ""HIGHER AWARENESS BUT LOWER BEHAVIOR GAP"" REPRESENTED GAPS FROM HIGHER-SCORING CONSTRUCTS (INCLUDING AWARENESS OF ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES CAUSED BY RUMORS, ASCRIBED RESPONSIBILITY OF ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES, SENSE OF OBLIGATION AND BEHAVIORAL INTENTION TO COMBAT RUMORS) TO LOWER-SCORING ACTUAL BEHAVIOR, WHEREAS ""LOWER ATTITUDE BUT HIGHER BEHAVIOR GAP"" REPRESENTED THE GAP FROM LOWER-SCORING ATTITUDES TOWARD RUMOR COMBATING TO HIGHER-SCORING ACTUAL BEHAVIOR. THE RESULTS OF THE STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS DEMONSTRATED THAT THE PROPOSED MODEL HAD A SATISFACTORY LEVEL OF PREDICTION POWER FOR PRO-SOCIAL RUMOR COMBATING BEHAVIOR. THE FINDINGS ALSO SUPPORTED ALL THE HYPOTHESIZED RELATIONSHIPS AMONG THE MODEL CONSTRUCTS EXCEPT THE DIRECT INFLUENCES OF SUBJECTIVE NORMS AND PERCEIVED BEHAVIORAL CONTROL ON BEHAVIORAL INTENTION AND VERIFIED THE MEDIATING ROLES OF THE MODEL CONSTRUCTS. IN PARTICULAR, SUBJECTIVE NORMS, PERCEIVED BEHAVIORAL CONTROL AND AWARENESS OF ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES WERE THE THREE MOST IMPORTANT PREDICTORS OF ACTUAL RUMOR COMBATING BEHAVIOR.

THROUGHOUT THE 2016 US PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARIES AND GENERAL ELECTION CAMPAIGN, A NOTABLE FEATURE WAS THE PROLIFIC TWITTER USE OF REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE AND THEN NOMINEE, DONALD TRUMP. THIS USE HAS CONTINUED SINCE HIS ELECTION VICTORY AND INAUGURATION AS PRESIDENT. TRUMP'S USE OF TWITTER HAS DRAWN CRITICISM DUE TO HIS RHETORIC IN RELATION TO VARIOUS ISSUES, INCLUDING HILLARY CLINTON, THE SIZE OF THE CROWD IN ATTENDANCE AT HIS INAUGURATION, THE POLICIES OF THE FORMER OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, AND IMMIGRATION AND FOREIGN POLICY. ONE OF THE MOST NOTABLE FEATURES OF TRUMP'S TWITTER USE HAS BEEN HIS REPEATED RIDICULE OF THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA THROUGH PEJORATIVE LABELS SUCH AS ""FAKE NEWS"" AND ""FAKE MEDIA."" THESE LABELS HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED IN AN ATTEMPT TO DETER THE PUBLIC FROM TRUSTING MEDIA REPORTS, MANY OF WHICH ARE CRITICAL OF TRUMP'S PRESIDENCY, AND TO POSITION HIMSELF AS THE ONLY RELIABLE SOURCE OF TRUTH. HOWEVER, GIVEN THE CONTESTABLE NATURE OF OBJECTIVE TRUTH, IT CAN BE ARGUED THAT TRUMP HIMSELF IS A SERIAL OFFENDER IN THE PROPAGATION OF MIS- AND DISINFORMATION IN THE SAME VEIN THAT HE ACCUSES THE MEDIA. THIS ARTICLE ADOPTS A CORPUS ANALYSIS OF TRUMP'S TWITTER DISCOURSE TO HIGHLIGHT HIS ACCUSATIONS OF FAKE NEWS AND HOW HE OPERATES AS A SERIAL SPREADER OF MIS- AND DISINFORMATION.

8,IMPORTANCE OF INTERNET SURVEILLANCE IN PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY CONTROL AND PREVENTION EVIDENCE FROM A DIGITAL EPIDEMIOLOGIC STUDY DURING AVIAN INFLUENZA A H7N9 OUTBREAKS,"BACKGROUND: OUTBREAKS OF HUMAN INFECTION WITH A NEW AVIAN INFLUENZA A H7N9 VIRUS OCCURRED IN CHINA IN THE SPRING OF 2013. CONTROL AND PREVENTION OF A NEW HUMAN INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK CAN BE STRONGLY AFFECTED BY PUBLIC REACTION AND SOCIAL IMPACT THROUGH THE INTERNET AND SOCIAL MEDIA. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY AIMED TO INVESTIGATE THE POTENTIAL ROLES OF INTERNET SURVEILLANCE IN CONTROL AND PREVENTION OF THE HUMAN H7N9 OUTBREAKS. METHODS: OFFICIAL DATA FOR THE HUMAN H7N9 OUTBREAKS WERE COLLECTED VIA THE CHINA NATIONAL HEALTH AND FAMILY PLANNING COMMITTEE WEBSITE FROM MARCH 31 TO APRIL 24, 2013. WE OBTAINED DAILY POSTED AND FORWARDED NUMBER OF BLOGS FOR THE KEYWORD ""H7N9"" FROM SINA MICROBLOG WEBSITE AND A DAILY BAIDU ATTENTION INDEX (BAI) FROM BAIDU WEBSITE, WHICH REFLECTED PUBLIC ATTENTION TO THE OUTBREAK. RUMORS IDENTIFIED AND CONFIRMED BY THE AUTHORITIES WERE COLLECTED FROM BAIDU SEARCH ENGINE. RESULTS: BOTH DAILY POSTED AND FORWARDED NUMBER AND BAI FOR KEYWORD H7N9 INCREASED QUICKLY DURING THE FIRST 3 DAYS OF THE OUTBREAKS AND REMAINED AT A HIGH LEVEL FOR 5 DAYS. THE TOTAL DAILY POSTED AND FORWARDED NUMBER FOR H7N9 ON SINA MICROBLOG PEAKED AT 850,000 ON APRIL 3, FROM ZERO BLOGS BEFORE MARCH 31, INCREASING TO 97,726 ON APRIL 1 AND TO 370,607 ON APRIL 2, AND REMAINING ABOVE 500,000 FROM APRIL 5-8 BEFORE DECLINING TO 208,524 ON APRIL 12. THE TOTAL DAILY BAI SHOWED A SIMILAR PATTERN OF CHANGE TO THE TOTAL DAILY POSTED AND FORWARDED NUMBER OVER TIME FROM MARCH 31 TO APRIL 12. WHEN THE OUTBREAK LOCATIONS SPREAD, ESPECIALLY INTO OTHER AREAS OF THE SAME PROVINCE/CITY AND THE CAPITAL, BEIJING, DAILY POSTED AND FORWARDED NUMBER AND BAI INCREASED AGAIN TO A PEAK AT 368,500 AND 116,911, RESPECTIVELY. THE MEDIAN DAILY BAI DURING THE STUDIED 25 DAYS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER AMONG THE 7 PROVINCES/CITIES WITH REPORTED HUMAN H7N9 CASES THAN THE 2 PROVINCES WITHOUT ANY CASES (P=.001). SO WERE THE MEDIAN DAILY POSTED AND FORWARDED NUMBER AND DAILY BAI IN EACH PROVINCE/CITY EXCEPT ANHUI PROVINCE. WE RETRIEVED A TOTAL OF 32 CONFIRMED RUMORS SPREAD ACROSS 19 PROVINCES/CITIES IN CHINA. IN ALL, 84% (27/32) OF RUMORS WERE DISSEMINATED AND TRANSMITTED BY SOCIAL MEDIA. CONCLUSIONS: THE FIRST 3 DAYS OF AN EPIDEMIC IS A CRITICAL PERIOD FOR THE AUTHORITIES TO TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION THROUGH INTERNET SURVEILLANCE TO PREVENT AND CONTROL THE EPIDEMIC, INCLUDING PREPARATION OF PERSONNEL, TECHNOLOGY, AND OTHER RESOURCES; INFORMATION RELEASE; COLLECTION OF PUBLIC OPINION AND REACTION; AND CLARIFICATION, PREVENTION, AND CONTROL OF RUMORS.

SOURCES INCLUDED GOOGLE, GOOGLE FACT CHECK, FACEBOOK, YOUTUBE, TWITTER, FACT-CHECKING AGENCY WEBSITES, AND TELEVISION AND NEWSPAPER WEBSITES. QUANTITATIVE DATA WERE EXTRACTED, ENTERED IN AN EXCEL SPREADSHEET, AND ANALYZED DESCRIPTIVELY USING THE STATISTICAL PACKAGE R VERSION 4.0.3. WE CONDUCTED A CONTENT ANALYSIS OF THE QUALITATIVE INFORMATION FROM NEWS ARTICLES, ONLINE REPORTS AND BLOGS AND COMPARED WITH FINDINGS FROM QUANTITATIVE DATA. BASED ON THE FACTCHECKING AGENCY RATINGS, INFORMATION WAS CATEGORIZED AS TRUE, FALSE, MISLEADING, OR EXAGGERATED. RESULTS WE IDENTIFIED 637 COVID-19 VACCINE-RELATED ITEMS: 91% WERE RUMORS AND 9% WERE CONSPIRACY THEORIES FROM 52 COUNTRIES. OF THE 578 RUMORS, 36% WERE RELATED TO VACCINE DEVELOPMENT, AVAILABILITY, AND ACCESS, 20% RELATED TO MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY, 8% TO SAFETY, EFFICACY, AND ACCEPTANCE, AND THE REST WERE OTHER CATEGORIES. OF THE 637 ITEMS, 5% (30/) WERE TRUE, 83% (528/637) WERE FALSE, 10% (66/637) WERE MISLEADING, AND 2% (13/637) WERE EXAGGERATED. CONCLUSIONS RUMORS AND CONSPIRACY THEORIES MAY LEAD TO MISTRUST CONTRIBUTING TO VACCINE HESITANCY. TRACKING COVID-19 VACCINE MISINFORMATION IN REAL-TIME AND ENGAGING WITH SOCIAL MEDIA TO DISSEMINATE CORRECT INFORMATION COULD HELP SAFEGUARD THE PUBLIC AGAINST MISINFORMATION.

271,SHIFTING ATTENTION TO ACCURACY CAN REDUCE MISINFORMATION ONLINE,"IN RECENT YEARS, THERE HAS BEEN A GREAT DEAL OF CONCERN ABOUT THE PROLIFERATION OF FALSE AND MISLEADING NEWS ON SOCIAL MEDIA1Ã¢â‚¬â€œ4. ACADEMICS AND PRACTITIONERS ALIKE HAVE ASKED WHY PEOPLE SHARE SUCH MISINFORMATION, AND SOUGHT SOLUTIONS TO REDUCE THE SHARING OF MISINFORMATION5Ã¢â‚¬â€œ7. HERE, WE ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS BOTH OF THESE QUESTIONS. FIRST, WE FIND THAT THE VERACITY OF HEADLINES HAS LITTLE EFFECT ON SHARING INTENTIONS, DESPITE HAVING A LARGE EFFECT ON JUDGMENTS OF ACCURACY. THIS DISSOCIATION SUGGESTS THAT SHARING DOES NOT NECESSARILY INDICATE BELIEF. NONETHELESS, MOST PARTICIPANTS SAY IT IS IMPORTANT TO SHARE ONLY ACCURATE NEWS. TO SHED LIGHT ON THIS APPARENT CONTRADICTION, WE CARRIED OUT FOUR SURVEY EXPERIMENTS AND A FIELD EXPERIMENT ON TWITTER; THE RESULTS SHOW THAT SUBTLY SHIFTING ATTENTION TO ACCURACY INCREASES THE QUALITY OF NEWS THAT PEOPLE SUBSEQUENTLY SHARE. TOGETHER WITH ADDITIONAL COMPUTATIONAL ANALYSES, THESE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT PEOPLE OFTEN SHARE MISINFORMATION BECAUSE THEIR ATTENTION IS FOCUSED ON FACTORS OTHER THAN ACCURACYÃ¢â‚¬â€AND THEREFORE THEY FAIL TO IMPLEMENT A STRONGLYÃ‚Â HELD PREFERENCE FOR ACCURATE SHARING. OUR RESULTS CHALLENGE THE POPULAR CLAIM THAT PEOPLE VALUE PARTISANSHIP OVER ACCURACY8,9, AND PROVIDE EVIDENCE FOR SCALABLE ATTENTION-BASED INTERVENTIONS THAT SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS COULD EASILY IMPLEMENT TO COUNTER MISINFORMATION ONLINE.

445,SHARING OF FAKE NEWS ON SOCIAL MEDIA APPLICATION OF THE HONEYCOMB FRAMEWORK AND THE THIRDPERSON EFFECT HYPOTHESIS,"SHARING OF FAKE NEWS ON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS IS A GLOBAL CONCERN, WITH RESEARCH OFFERING LITTLE INSIGHT INTO THE MOTIVES BEHIND SUCH SHARING. THIS STUDY ADOPTS A MIXED-METHOD APPROACH TO EXPLORE FAKE-NEWS SHARING BEHAVIOUR. TO BEGIN WITH, QUALITATIVE DATA FROM 58 OPEN-ENDED ESSAYS WAS ANALYSED TO IDENTIFY SIX BEHAVIOURAL MANIFESTATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH SHARING FAKE NEWS. THEREAFTER, RESEARCH MODEL HYPOTHESIZING THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THESE BEHAVIOURS WAS PROPOSED USING THE HONEYCOMB FRAMEWORK AND THE THIRD-PERSON EFFECT HYPOTHESIS. AGE AND GENDER WERE THE CONTROL VARIABLES. TWO DATA SETS OBTAINED FROM CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEYS WITH 471 AND 374 SOCIAL MEDIA USERS WERE UTILIZED TO TEST THE PROPOSED MODEL. THE STUDY RESULTS SUGGEST THAT INSTANTANEOUS SHARING OF NEWS FOR CREATING AWARENESS HAD POSITIVE EFFECT ON SHARING FAKE NEWS DUE TO LACK OF TIME AND RELIGIOSITY. HOWEVER, AUTHENTICATING NEWS BEFORE SHARING HAD NO EFFECT ON SHARING FAKE NEWS DUE TO LACK OF TIME AND RELIGIOSITY. THE STUDY RESULTS ALSO SUGGEST THAT SOCIAL MEDIA USERS WHO ENGAGE IN ACTIVE CORRECTIVE ACTION ARE UNLIKELY TO SHARE FAKE NEWS DUE TO LACK OF TIME. THESE RESULTS HAVE SIGNIFICANT THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS.

HOWEVER, SCHOLARSHIP DEDICATED TO THIS AREA IS LACKING. USING A RECENT DEVELOPMENT IN THE FIELD OF COMPUTATIONAL NETWORK SCIENCE (I.E., EVOLUTION TREE ANALYSIS), THIS STUDY EXAMINED THIS ISSUE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE 2016 US PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. BY RETRIEVING 307,738 TWEETS ABOUT 30 FAKE AND 30 REAL NEWS STORIES, WE EXAMINED THE ROOT CONTENT, PRODUCERS OF ORIGINAL SOURCE, AND EVOLUTION PATTERNS. THE FINDINGS REVEALED THAT ROOT TWEETS ABOUT FAKE NEWS WERE MOSTLY GENERATED BY ACCOUNTS FROM ORDINARY USERS, BUT THEY OFTEN INCLUDED A LINK TO NON-CREDIBLE NEWS WEBSITES. ADDITIONALLY, WE OBSERVED SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN REAL AND FAKE NEWS STORIES IN TERMS OF EVOLUTION PATTERNS. IN OUR EVOLUTION TREE ANALYSIS, TWEETS ABOUT REAL NEWS SHOWED WIDER BREADTH AND SHORTER DEPTH THAN TWEETS ABOUT FAKE NEWS. THE RESULTS ALSO INDICATED THAT TWEETS ABOUT REAL NEWS SPREAD WIDELY AND QUICKLY, BUT TWEETS ABOUT FAKE NEWS UNDERWENT A GREATER NUMBER OF MODIFICATIONS IN CONTENT OVER THE SPREADING PROCESS.

99,ARE INTERNET VIDEOS USEFUL SOURCES OF INFORMATION DURING GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES A CASE STUDY OF YOUTUBE VIDEOS DURING THE 201516 ZIKA VIRUS PANDEMIC,"BACKGROUND: INTERNET-VIDEOS, THOUGH POPULAR SOURCES OF PUBLIC HEALTH INFORMATION, ARE OFTEN UNVERIFIED AND ANECDOTAL. WE CRITICALLY EVALUATED YOUTUBE VIDEOS ABOUT ZIKA VIRUS AVAILABLE DURING THE RECENT ZIKA PANDEMIC. METHODS: HUNDRED-AND-ONE VIDEOS WERE RETRIEVED FROM YOUTUBE (SEARCH TERM: ZIKA VIRUS). BASED UPON CONTENT, THEY WERE CLASSIFIED AS: INFORMATIVE, MISLEADING OR PERSONAL EXPERIENCE VIDEOS. QUALITY AND RELIABILITY OF THESE VIDEOS WERE EVALUATED USING STANDARDIZED TOOLS. THE VIEWER INTERACTION METRICS (E.G. NO. OF VIEWS, SHARES, ETC.), VIDEO CHARACTERISTICS (VIDEO LENGTH, ETC.) AND THE SOURCES OF UPLOAD WERE ALSO ASSESSED; AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE TYPE, QUALITY AND RELIABILITY OF THE VIDEOS ANALYZED. RESULTS: OVERALL, 70.3% VIDEOS WERE INFORMATIVE, WHILE 23.8% AND 5.9% VIDEOS WERE MISLEADING AND RELATED TO PERSONAL EXPERIENCES, RESPECTIVELY. ALTHOUGH WITH SHORTER LENGTHS (PÃ‚Â <Ã‚Â 0.01) AND SUPERIOR QUALITY (PÃ‚Â <Ã‚Â 0.01), YET INFORMATIVE VIDEOS WERE VIEWED (PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.054), LIKED (PÃ‚Â <Ã‚Â 0.01) AND SHARED (PÃ‚Â <Ã‚Â 0.05) LESS OFTEN THAN THEIR MISLEADING COUNTERPARTS. VIDEOS FROM INDEPENDENT USERS WERE MORE LIKELY TO BE MISLEADING (ADJUSTED ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 6.48, 95% CI: 1.69Ã¢â‚¬â€œ24.83), OF POORER (PÃ‚Â <Ã‚Â 0.05) QUALITY AND RELIABILITY THAN GOVERNMENT/NEWS AGENCY VIDEOS. CONCLUSION: A CONSIDERABLE CHUNK OF THE VIDEOS WERE MISLEADING. THEY WERE MORE POPULAR (THAN INFORMATIVE VIDEOS) AND COULD POTENTIALLY SPREAD MISINFORMATION. VIDEOS FROM TRUSTWORTHY SOURCES LIKE UNIVERSITY/HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS WERE SCARCE. CURATION/AUTHENTICATION OF HEALTH INFORMATION IN ONLINE VIDEO PLATFORMS (LIKE YOUTUBE) IS NECESSARY. WE DISCUSS MEANS TO HARNESS THEM AS USEFUL SOURCE OF INFORMATION AND HIGHLIGHT MEASURES TO CURB DISSEMINATION OF MISINFORMATION DURING PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES.

616,GOING VIRAL HOW A SINGLE TWEET SPAWNED A COVID19 CONSPIRACY THEORY ON TWITTER,"IN LATE MARCH OF 2020, A NEW HASHTAG, #FILMYOURHOSPITAL, MADE ITS FIRST APPEARANCE ON SOCIAL MEDIA. THE HASHTAG ENCOURAGED PEOPLE TO VISIT LOCAL HOSPITALS TO TAKE PICTURES AND VIDEOS OF EMPTY HOSPITALS TO HELP ""PROVE"" THAT THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IS AN ELABORATE HOAX. USING TECHNIQUES FROM SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS, THIS CASE STUDY EXAMINES HOW THIS CONSPIRACY THEORY PROPAGATED ON TWITTER AND WHETHER THE HASHTAG VIRALITY WAS AIDED BY THE USE OF AUTOMATION OR COORDINATION AMONG TWITTER USERS. WE FOUND THAT WHILE MUCH OF THE CONTENT CAME FROM USERS WITH LIMITED REACH, THE OXYGEN THAT FUELED THIS CONSPIRACY IN ITS EARLY DAYS CAME FROM A HANDFUL OF PROMINENT CONSERVATIVE POLITICIANS AND FAR RIGHT POLITICAL ACTIVISTS ON TWITTER. THESE POWER USERS USED THIS HASHTAG TO BUILD AWARENESS ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN AND TO ENCOURAGE THEIR FOLLOWERS TO BREAK QUARANTINE AND FILM WHAT IS HAPPENING AT THEIR LOCAL HOSPITALS. AFTER THE INITIAL BOOST BY A FEW PROMINENT ACCOUNTS, THE CAMPAIGN WAS MOSTLY SUSTAINED BY PRO-TRUMP ACCOUNTS, FOLLOWED BY A SECONDARY WAVE OF PROPAGATION OUTSIDE THE U.S. THE RISE OF THE #FILMYOURHOSPITAL CONSPIRACY FROM A SINGLE TWEET DEMONSTRATES THE ONGOING CHALLENGE OF ADDRESSING FALSE, VIRAL INFORMATION DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. WHILE THE SPREAD OF MISINFORMATION CAN BE POTENTIALLY MITIGATED BY FACT-CHECKING AND DIRECTING PEOPLE TO CREDIBLE SOURCES OF INFORMATION FROM PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCIES, FALSE AND MISLEADING CLAIMS THAT ARE DRIVEN BY POLITICS AND SUPPORTED BY STRONG CONVICTIONS AND NOT SCIENCE ARE MUCH HARDER TO ROOT OUT.",SOCIAL MEDIA; TWITTER; COVID-19; CONSPIRACY THEORY; ONLINE NETWORKS; #FILMYOURHOSPITAL,NA,2020,https://doi.org/10.1177/2053951720938405,"7,8",NA,0,0,0,CANADA,BIG DATA & SOCIETY
290,THE ANTIVACCINATION INFODEMIC ON SOCIAL MEDIA A BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS,"VACCINATIONS ARE WITHOUT DOUBT ONE OF THE GREATEST ACHIEVEMENTS OF MODERN MEDICINE, AND THERE IS HOPE THAT THEY CAN CONSTITUTE A SOLUTION TO HALT THE ONGOING COVID-19 PANDEMIC. HOWEVER, THE ANTI-VACCINATION MOVEMENT IS CURRENTLY ON THE RISE, SPREADING ONLINE MISINFORMATION ABOUT VACCINE SAFETY AND CAUSING A WORRYING REDUCTION IN VACCINATION RATES WORLDWIDE. IN THIS HISTORICAL TIME, IT IS IMPERATIVE TO UNDERSTAND THE REASONS OF VACCINE HESITANCY, AND TO FIND EFFECTIVE STRATEGIES TO DISMANTLE THE RHETORIC OF ANTI-VACCINATION SUPPORTERS. FOR THIS REASON, WE ANALYZED THE BEHAVIOR OF ANTI-VACCINATION SUPPORTERS ON THE PLATFORM TWITTER. HERE WE IDENTIFY THAT ANTI-VACCINATION SUPPORTERS, IN COMPARISON WITH PRO-VACCINATION SUPPORTERS, SHARE CONSPIRACY THEORIES AND MAKE USE OF EMOTIONAL LANGUAGE. WE DEMONSTRATE THAT ANTI-VACCINATION SUPPORTERS ARE MORE ENGAGED IN DISCUSSIONS ON TWITTER AND SHARE THEIR CONTENTS FROM A PULL OF STRONG INFLUENCERS. WE SHOW THAT THE MOVEMENT'S SUCCESS RELIES ON A STRONG SENSE OF COMMUNITY, BASED ON THE CONTENTS PRODUCED BY A SMALL FRACTION OF PROFILES, WITH THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE SERVING AS A SOUNDING BOARD FOR ANTI-VACCINATION DISCOURSE TO CIRCULATE ONLINE. OUR DATA DEMONSTRATE THAT DONALD TRUMP, BEFORE HIS PROFILE WAS SUSPENDED, WAS THE MAIN DRIVER OF VACCINE MISINFORMATION ON TWITTER. BASED ON THESE RESULTS, WE WELCOME POLICIES THAT AIM AT HALTING THE CIRCULATION OF FALSE INFORMATION ABOUT VACCINES BY TARGETING THE ANTI-VACCINATION COMMUNITY ON TWITTER. BASED ON OUR DATA, WE ALSO PROPOSE SOLUTIONS TO IMPROVE THE COMMUNICATION STRATEGY OF HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS AND BUILD A COMMUNITY OF ENGAGED INFLUENCERS THAT SUPPORT THE DISSEMINATION OF SCIENTIFIC INSIGHTS, INCLUDING ISSUES RELATED TO VACCINES AND THEIR SAFETY.

IN AN ENVIRONMENT OF UBIQUITOUS ONLINE SOCIAL SHARING, WE CONTEND THAT IT IS THE INDIVIDUALS THAT CAN PLAY A MAJOR ROLE IN HALTING THE SPREAD OF MISINFORMATION. WE CONDUCTED A SURVEY (N = 396) TO ILLUMINATE THE FACTORS THAT PREDICT (I) THE PERCEIVED ABILITY TO RECOGNISE FALSE INFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA, AND (II) THE BEHAVIOUR OF SHARING OF INFORMATION WITHOUT VERIFICATION. A SET OF REGRESSION ANALYSES REVEAL THAT THE PERCEIVED SELF-EFFICACY TO DETECT MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA IS PREDICTED BY INCOME AND LEVEL OF EDUCATION, INTERNET SKILLS OF INFORMATION SEEKING AND VERIFICATION, AND ATTITUDE TOWARDS INFORMATION VERIFICATION. WE ALSO FOUND THAT SHARING OF INFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA WITHOUT VERIFICATION IS PREDICTED BY INTERNET EXPERIENCE, INTERNET SKILLS OF INFORMATION SEEKING, SHARING, AND VERIFICATION, ATTITUDE TOWARDS INFORMATION VERIFICATION, AND BELIEF IN THE RELIABILITY OF INFORMATION.

IT FINDS THAT ORDINARY CITIZENS MADE UP THE LARGEST CATEGORY OF INITIATORS BUT THAT THEIR POWER OF OPINION LEADERSHIP WAS LIMITED AS THEY HAD TO RELY ON MEDIA ORGANIZATIONS TO SPREAD NEWS ABOUT THE CASES. NEWS ORGANIZATIONS AND ONLINE MEDIA WERE THE MAIN OPINION LEADERS. GOVERNMENT AND PARTY BODIES INITIATED A FAIR NUMBER OF CASES AND, DESPITE NOT BEING STRONG AGENDA SETTERS OR DISSEMINATORS, WERE ABLE TO DOMINATE PUBLIC OPINION OWING TO THE FACT THAT NEWS ORGANIZATIONS AND ONLINE MEDIA MAINLY PUBLISHED OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENTS ABOUT THE CASES. MEDIA ORGANIZATIONS ALSO PLAYED A SECONDARY ROLE AS THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE.

BY USING A COMPUTATIONAL TOOL KNOWN AS DYNAMIC ACTIVITY-CONNECTIVITY MAPS, BASED ON NETWORK AND TEMPORAL ACTIVITY PATTERNS, WE INVESTIGATE THE DYNAMICS OF SOCIAL INFLUENCE WITHIN ISIS SUPPORTERS. WE FINALLY QUANTIFY THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ISIS PROPAGANDA BY DETERMINING THE ADOPTION OF EXTREMIST CONTENT IN THE GENERAL POPULATION AND DRAW A PARALLEL BETWEEN RADICAL PROPAGANDA AND EPIDEMICS SPREADING, HIGHLIGHTING THAT INFORMATION BROADCASTERS AND INFLUENTIAL ISIS SUPPORTERS GENERATE HIGHLY-INFECTIOUS CASCADES OF INFORMATION CONTAGION.

WE FOUND THAT THE PRESENCE OF A FAKE NEWS FLAG TRIGGERED INCREASED COGNITIVE ACTIVITY AND USERS SPENT MORE TIME CONSIDERING THE HEADLINE. HOWEVER, THE FLAG HAD NO EFFECT ON JUDGMENTS ABOUT TRUTH; FLAGGING HEADLINES AS FALSE DID NOT INFLUENCE USERS' BELIEFS. A POST HOC ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT CONFIRMATION BIAS IS PERVASIVE, WITH USERS MORE LIKELY TO BELIEVE NEWS HEADLINES THAT ALIGN WITH THEIR POLITICAL OPINIONS.

499,POLITICAL ASTROTURFING ON TWITTER HOW TO COORDINATE A DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN,"POLITICAL ASTROTURFING, A CENTRALLY COORDINATED DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN IN WHICH PARTICIPANTS PRETEND TO BE ORDINARY CITIZENS ACTING INDEPENDENTLY, HAS THE POTENTIAL TO INFLUENCE ELECTORAL OUTCOMES AND OTHER FORMS OF POLITICAL BEHAVIOR. YET, IT IS HARD TO EVALUATE THE SCOPE AND EFFECTIVENESS OF POLITICAL ASTROTURFING WITHOUT Ã¢â‚¬Å“GROUND TRUTHÃ¢â‚¬Â INFORMATION, SUCH AS THE VERIFIED IDENTITY OF ITS AGENTS AND INSTIGATORS. IN THIS PAPER, WE STUDY THE SOUTH KOREAN NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S (NIS) DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN DURING THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN 2012, TAKING ADVANTAGE OF A LIST OF PARTICIPATING ACCOUNTS PUBLISHED IN COURT PROCEEDINGS. FEATURES THAT BEST DISTINGUISH THESE ACCOUNTS FROM REGULAR USERS IN CONTEMPORANEOUSLY COLLECTED TWITTER DATA ARE TRACES LEFT BY COORDINATION AMONG ASTROTURFING AGENTS, INSTEAD OF THE INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNT CHARACTERISTICS TYPICALLY USED IN RELATED APPROACHES SUCH AS SOCIAL BOT DETECTION. WE DEVELOP A METHODOLOGY THAT EXPLOITS THESE DISTINCT EMPIRICAL PATTERNS TO IDENTIFY ADDITIONAL LIKELY ASTROTURFING ACCOUNTS AND VALIDATE THIS DETECTION STRATEGY BY ANALYZING THEIR MESSAGES AND CURRENT ACCOUNT STATUS. HOWEVER, AN ANALYSIS RELYING ON TWITTER INFLUENCE METRICS SHOWS THAT THE KNOWN AND SUSPECT NIS ACCOUNTS ONLY HAD A LIMITED IMPACT ON POLITICAL SOCIAL MEDIA DISCUSSIONS. BY USING THE PRINCIPAL-AGENT FRAMEWORK TO ANALYZE ONE OF THE EARLIEST REVEALED INSTANCES OF POLITICAL ASTROTURFING, WE IMPROVE ON EXTANT METHODOLOGICAL APPROACHES TO DETECT DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGNS AND GROUND THEM MORE FIRMLY IN SOCIAL SCIENCE THEORY.

102,RUMOR RESPONSE DEBUNKING RESPONSE AND DECISION MAKINGS OF MISINFORMED TWITTER USERS DURING DISASTERS,"THE RAPID SPREAD OF RUMORS OCCURRING ON SOCIAL MEDIA IS A CRITICAL PROBLEM THAT POSES A GREAT RISK TO EMERGENCY SITUATION NAVIGATION, ESPECIALLY DURING DISASTERS. MANY RESEARCH QUESTIONS, SUCH AS HOW MISINFORMED USERS JUDGE POTENTIAL RUMORS OR HOW THEY RESPOND TO THEM, ARE CRUCIAL ISSUES FOR CRISIS COMMUNICATION, BUT HAVE NOT BEEN EXTENSIVELY STUDIED. THIS PAPER FILLS THIS GAP BY ORIGINALLY DOCUMENTING AND STUDYING TWITTER USERSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ RUMOR AND DEBUNKING RESPONSE BEHAVIORS DURING DISASTERS, SUCH AS HURRICANE SANDY IN 2012 AND THE BOSTON MARATHON BOMBINGS IN 2013. TO THIS END, TWO RUMORS FROM EACH DISASTER AND THEIR RELATED TWEETS ARE DOCUMENTED FOR ANALYSIS. USERS WHO WERE MISINFORMED AND INVOLVED IN THE RUMOR TOPIC BY POSTING TWEET(S), COULD RESPOND TO A RUMOR BY: (1) SPREADING (85.86Ã¢â‚¬â€œ91.40%), (2) CONFIRMATION-SEEKING (5.39Ã¢â‚¬â€œ9.37%), OR (3) DOUBTING (0.71Ã¢â‚¬â€œ8.75%). HOWEVER, IF THE RUMOR-SPREADING USERS WERE DEBUNKED, THEY WOULD RESPOND BY: (1) DELETING RUMOR TWEET(S) (2.94Ã¢â‚¬â€œhttps://doi.org/10.00%), (2) CLARIFYING RUMOR INFORMATION WITH A NEW TWEET (0Ã¢â‚¬â€œ19.75%), OR (3) NEITHER DELETING NOR CLARIFYING (78.13Ã¢â‚¬â€œ97.06%). WE CONCLUDE THAT TWITTER USERS PERFORM POORLY IN RUMOR DETECTION AND RUSH TO SPREAD RUMORS.

ALTHOUGH SOCIAL MEDIA OFFERS ORGANISATIONS PROMOTING VACCINATION UNPARALLELED OPPORTUNITIES TO PROMOTE EVIDENCE AND COUNTERBALANCE MISINFORMATION, WE KNOW RELATIVELY LITTLE ABOUT THEIR INTERNAL WORKINGS. THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXPLORE THE STRATEGIES, PERSPECTIVES AND EXPERIENCES OF COMMUNICATORS WORKING WITHIN SUCH ORGANISATIONS AS THEY PROMOTE VACCINATION AND RESPOND TO MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA. METHODS: USING QUALITATIVE METHODS, WE PURPOSIVELY SAMPLED 21 PARTICIPANTS RESPONSIBLE FOR ROUTINE SOCIAL MEDIA ACTIVITY AND STRATEGY FROM AUSTRALIAN ORGANISATIONS ACTIVELY PROMOTING VACCINATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA, INCLUDING GOVERNMENT HEALTH DEPARTMENTS, LOCAL HEALTH SERVICES, ADVOCACY GROUPS, PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS AND TECHNICAL/SCIENTIFIC ORGANISATIONS. WE CONDUCTED SEMI-STRUCTURED, IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS TO EXPLORE THEIR PERSPECTIVES AND PRACTICES. APPLYING RISK COMMUNICATION PRINCIPLES AS A LENS, WE USED FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS TO EXPLORE THE DATA BOTH INDUCTIVELY AND DEDUCTIVELY. RESULTS: ORGANISATIONS PROMOTING VACCINATION FACE MULTIPLE CHALLENGES ON SOCIAL MEDIA, INCLUDING MISINFORMATION, ANTI-SCIENCE SENTIMENT, A COMPLEX VACCINATION NARRATIVE AND ANTI-VACCINE ACTIVISTS. THEY DEVELOPED A RANGE OF SOPHISTICATED STRATEGIES IN RESPONSE, INCLUDING COMMUNICATING WITH OPENNESS IN AN EVIDENCE-INFORMED WAY; CREATING SAFE SPACES TO ENCOURAGE AUDIENCE DIALOGUE; FOSTERING COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS; AND COUNTERING MISINFORMATION WITH CARE. CONCLUSIONS: WE RECOMMEND THAT COMMUNICATORS CONSIDER DIRECTLY COUNTERING MISINFORMATION BECAUSE OF THE POTENTIAL INFLUENCE ON THEIR SILENT AUDIENCE, I.E. THOSE OBSERVING BUT NOT OPENLY COMMENTING, LIKING OR SHARING POSTS. REFUTATIONS SHOULD BE STRAIGHTFORWARD, SUCCINCT AND AVOID EMPHASIZING MISINFORMATION. COMMUNICATORS SHOULD CONSIDER PAIRING SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE WITH STORIES THAT SPEAK TO AUDIENCE BELIEFS AND VALUES. FINALLY, ORGANISATIONS COULD ENHANCE VACCINE PROMOTION AND THEIR OWN CREDIBILITY ON SOCIAL MEDIA BY FORMING STRONG LINKS WITH ORGANISATIONS SHARING SIMILAR VALUES AND GOALS.

504,THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SHORTFORMAT REFUTATIONAL FACTCHECKS,"FACT-CHECKING HAS BECOME AN IMPORTANT FEATURE OF THE MODERN MEDIA LANDSCAPE. HOWEVER, IT IS UNCLEAR WHAT THE MOST EFFECTIVE FORMAT OF FACT-CHECKS IS. SOME HAVE ARGUED THAT SIMPLE RETRACTIONS THAT REPEAT A FALSE CLAIM AND TAG IT AS FALSE MAY BACKFIRE BECAUSE THEY BOOST THE CLAIM'S FAMILIARITY. MORE DETAILED REFUTATIONS MAY PROVIDE A MORE PROMISING APPROACH, BUT MAY NOT BE FEASIBLE UNDER THE SEVERE SPACE CONSTRAINTS ASSOCIATED WITH SOCIAL-MEDIA COMMUNICATION. IN TWO EXPERIMENTS, WE TESTED WHETHER (1) SIMPLE Ã¢â‚¬ËœFALSE-TAGÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ RETRACTIONS CAN INDEED BE INEFFECTIVE OR HARMFUL; AND (2) SHORT-FORMAT (140-CHARACTER) REFUTATIONS ARE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN SIMPLE RETRACTIONS. REGARDING (1), SIMPLE RETRACTIONS REDUCED BELIEF IN FALSE CLAIMS, AND WE FOUND NO EVIDENCE FOR A FAMILIARITY-DRIVEN BACKFIRE EFFECT. REGARDING (2), SHORT-FORMAT REFUTATIONS WERE FOUND TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN SIMPLE RETRACTIONS AFTER A 1-WEEK DELAY BUT NOT A ONE-DAY DELAY. AT BOTH DELAYS, HOWEVER, THEY WERE ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCED MISINFORMATION-CONGRUENT REASONING. Ã‚Â© 2019 THE AUTHORS.

100,STATE MEDIA AND CIVIL SOCIETY IN THE INFORMATION WARFARE OVER UKRAINE CITIZEN CURATORS OF DIGITAL DISINFORMATION,"THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE DYNAMICS OF DIGITAL (DIS)INFORMATION IN THE CONFLICT BETWEEN RUSSIA AND UKRAINE. INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS SCHOLARS HAVE PRESENTED THE ONLINE DEBATE IN TERMS OF 'INFORMATION WARFARE'-THAT IS, A NUMBER OF STRATEGIC CAMPAIGNS TO WIN OVER LOCAL AND GLOBAL PUBLIC OPINION, LARGELY ORCHESTRATED BY THE KREMLIN AND PRO-WESTERN AUTHORITIES. HOWEVER, THIS WAY OF DESCRIBING THE ONLINE DEBATE REDUCES CIVIL SOCIETY TO A MERE TARGET FOR MANIPULATION. THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS A DIFFERENT UNDERSTANDING OF THE DEBATE. BY EXAMINING THE SOCIAL MEDIA ENGAGEMENT GENERATED BY ONE OF THE CONFLICT'S MOST IMPORTANT EVENTS-THE DOWNING OF THE MALAYSIAN AIRLINES FLIGHT 17 (MH17) OVER UKRAINE-WE EXPLORE HOW COMPETING CLAIMS ABOUT THE CAUSE OF THE PLANE CRASH ARE DISSEMINATED BY THE STATE, MEDIA AND CIVIL SOCIETY. BY ANALYSING APPROXIMATELY 950,000 TWEETS, THE ARTICLE DEMONSTRATES HOW INDIVIDUAL CITIZENS ARE MORE THAN PURVEYORS OF GOVERNMENT MESSAGES; THEY ARE THE MOST ACTIVE DRIVERS OF BOTH DISINFORMATION AND ATTEMPTS TO COUNTER SUCH INFORMATION. THESE CITIZEN CURATORS ACTIVELY SHAPE COMPETING NARRATIVES ABOUT WHY MH17 CRASHED AND CITIZENS, AS A GROUP, ARE FOUR TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE RETWEETED THAN ANY OTHER TYPE OF USER. OUR FINDINGS CHALLENGE CONCEPTUALIZATIONS OF A STATE-ORCHESTRATED INFORMATION WAR OVER UKRAINE, AND POINT TO THE IMPORTANCE OF CITIZEN ACTIVITY IN THE STRUGGLE OVER TRUTHS DURING INTERNATIONAL CONFLICTS.

THIS STUDY ANALYZED SOCIAL MEDIA ACTIVITY THAT OCCURRED DURING AND AFTER TWO ACTIVE SHOOTER EVENTS ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2014. OVER 5000 SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS FROM FACEBOOK, TWITTER, BLOGS, AND MAINSTREAM NEWS OUTLETS WERE ANALYZED. SOCIAL MEDIA ANALYSIS OUTLINED THE SCOPE OF ONLINE COMMUNICATION DURING THE FIRST WEEK FOLLOWING THE INCIDENTS, REVEALED SOCIAL MEDIA FREQUENCY, INCREASES IN CONVERSATION, MISINFORMATION, AND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PARENT AND STUDENT POSTS. RESULTS REVEALED SPIKES IN SOCIAL MEDIA CHATTER FOLLOWING THE RELEASE OF THE IDENTITIES OF SHOOTERS AND VICTIMS. CONSISTENT WITH MEDIA DEPENDENCY THEORY AND THE HIGH LEVELS OF UNCERTAINTY CHARACTERISTIC OF THE INCIDENT, USERS' SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS CONTAINED MORE INFORMATION THAN AFFECT DISPLAYS DURING THE ACTIVE SHOOTER EVENT.

THIS CLASH IS PARTICULARLY EVIDENT ON SOCIAL MEDIA. FACEBOOK HAS TAKEN A PRIME ROLE IN DISSEMINATING FAKE NEWS, ALTERNATE FACTS, AND PSEUDOSCIENCE, BUT IS OFTEN IGNORED IN THE CONTEXT OF SCIENCE OUTREACH, ESPECIALLY AMONG INDIVIDUAL SCIENTISTS. BASED ON NEW SURVEY DATA, SCIENTISTS APPEAR IN LARGE FACEBOOK NETWORKS BUT SELDOM POST INFORMATION ABOUT GENERAL SCIENCE, THEIR OWN SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, OR CULTURALLY CONTROVERSIAL TOPICS IN SCIENCE. THE TYPICAL INDIVIDUAL SCIENTISTÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S AUDIENCE IS LARGE AND PERSONALLY CONNECTED, POTENTIALLY LEADING TO BOTH A BROAD AND DEEP ENGAGEMENT IN SCIENCE. MOREOVER, THIS MEDIA VALUES INDIVIDUAL EXPERTISE, ALLOWING SCIENTISTS TO SERVE AS A Ã¢â‚¬Å“NERD OF TRUSTÃ¢â‚¬Â FOR THEIR ONLINE FRIEND AND FAMILY NETWORKS.

106,LINGUISTIC SIGNALS UNDER MISINFORMATION AND FACTCHECKING EVIDENCE FROM USER COMMENTS ON SOCIAL MEDIA,"MISINFORMATION AND FACT-CHECKING ARE OPPOSITE FORCES IN THE NEWS ENVIRONMENT: THE FORMER CREATES INACCURACIES TO MISLEAD PEOPLE, WHILE THE LATTER PROVIDES EVIDENCE TO REBUT THE FORMER. THESE NEWS ARTICLES ARE OFTEN POSTED ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND ATTRACT USER ENGAGEMENT IN THE FORM OF COMMENTS. IN THIS PAPER, WE INVESTIGATE LINGUISTIC (ESPECIALLY EMOTIONAL AND TOPICAL) SIGNALS EXPRESSED IN USER COMMENTS IN THE PRESENCE OF MISINFORMATION AND FACT-CHECKING. WE COLLECT AND ANALYZE A DATASET OF 5,303 SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS WITH 2,614,374 USER COMMENTS FROM FACEBOOK, TWITTER, AND YOUTUBE, AND ASSOCIATE THESE POSTS TO FACT-CHECK ARTICLES FROM SNOPES AND POLITIFACT FOR VERACITY RULINGS (I.E., FROM TRUE TO FALSE). WE FIND THAT LINGUISTIC SIGNALS IN USER COMMENTS VARY SIGNIFICANTLY WITH THE VERACITY OF POSTS, E.G., WE OBSERVE MORE MISINFORMATION-AWARENESS SIGNALS AND EXTENSIVE EMOJI AND SWEAR WORD USAGE WITH FALSER POSTS. WE FURTHER SHOW THAT THESE SIGNALS CAN HELP TO DETECT MISINFORMATION. IN ADDITION, WE FIND THAT WHILE THERE ARE SIGNALS INDICATING POSITIVE EFFECTS AFTER FACT-CHECKING, THERE ARE ALSO SIGNALS INDICATING POTENTIAL Ã¢â‚¬Å“BACKFIREÃ¢â‚¬Â EFFECTS.

85,NATURE AND DIFFUSION OF GYNECOLOGIC CANCERRELATED MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA ANALYSIS OF TWEETS,"BACKGROUND: OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES, THE INCIDENCE AND MORTALITY RATES OF GYNECOLOGIC CANCERS HAVE INCREASED AT A CONSTANT RATE IN CHINA. GYNECOLOGIC CANCERS HAVE BECOME ONE OF THE MOST SERIOUS THREATS TO WOMEN'S HEALTH IN CHINA. WITH THE WIDESPREAD USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA, AN INCREASING NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS HAVE EMPLOYED SOCIAL MEDIA TO PRODUCE, SEEK, AND SHARE CANCER-RELATED INFORMATION. HOWEVER, HEALTH INFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA IS NOT ALWAYS ACCURATE. HEALTH, AND ESPECIALLY CANCER-RELATED, MISINFORMATION HAS BEEN WIDELY SPREAD ON SOCIAL MEDIA, WHICH CAN AFFECT INDIVIDUALS' ATTITUDINAL AND BEHAVIORAL RESPONSES TO CANCER. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE NATURE AND DIFFUSION OF GYNECOLOGIC CANCER-RELATED MISINFORMATION ON WEIBO, THE CHINESE EQUIVALENT OF TWITTER. METHODS: A TOTAL OF 2691 TWEETS RELATED TO 2 GYNECOLOGIC CANCERS-BREAST CANCER AND CERVICAL CANCER-POSTED ON WEIBO FROM JUNE 2015 TO JUNE 2016 WERE EXTRACTED USING THE PYTHON WEB CRAWLER. TWO MEDICAL SCHOOL GRADUATE STUDENTS WITH EXPERTISE IN GYNECOLOGIC DISEASES WERE RECRUITED TO CODE THE TWEETS TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN TRUE INFORMATION AND MISINFORMATION AS WELL AS TO IDENTIFY THE TYPES OF FALSEHOODS. THE DIFFUSION CHARACTERISTICS OF GYNECOLOGIC CANCER-RELATED MISINFORMATION WERE COMPARED WITH THOSE OF THE TRUE INFORMATION. RESULTS: WHILE MOST OF THE GYNECOLOGIC CANCER-RELATED TWEETS PROVIDED MEDICALLY ACCURATE INFORMATION, APPROXIMATELY 30% OF THEM WERE FOUND TO CONTAIN MISINFORMATION. FURTHERMORE, IT WAS FOUND THAT TWEETS ABOUT CANCER TREATMENT CONTAINED A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF MISINFORMATION THAN PREVENTION-RELATED TWEETS. NEVERTHELESS, THE PREVENTION-RELATED MISINFORMATION DIFFUSED SIGNIFICANTLY MORE BROADLY AND DEEPLY THAN TRUE INFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA. CONCLUSIONS: THE FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY SUGGEST THE NEED FOR CONTROLLING AND REDUCING THE CANCER-RELATED MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA WITH THE EFFORTS FROM BOTH SERVICE PROVIDERS AND MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS. MORE SPECIFICALLY, IT IS IMPORTANT TO CORRECT FALSEHOODS RELATED TO THE PREVENTION OF GYNECOLOGIC CANCERS ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND INCREASE INDIVIDUALS' CAPACITY TO ASSESS THE VERACITY OF WEB-BASED INFORMATION TO CURB THE SPREAD AND THUS MINIMIZE THE CONSEQUENCES OF CANCER-RELATED MISINFORMATION.

136,YOUTUBE ENGLISH VIDEOS AS A SOURCE OF INFORMATION ON BREAST SELFEXAMINATION,"OBJECTIVE: TO EXAMINE THE CONTENT, QUALITY AND RELIABILITY OF YOUTUBE VIDEOS RELATED TO BREAST SELF-EXAMINATION. DESIGN: A SEARCH OF YOUTUBE WAS MADE ON 21.06.2018 USING THE KEYWORD OF Ã¢â‚¬Å“BREAST SELF-EXAMINATIONÃ¢â‚¬Â. THE VIDEOS WERE CATEGORISED BY TWO DOCTORS AS USEFUL INFORMATION OR MISLEADING INFORMATION. TO EVALUATE THE QUALITY OF THE VIDEOS, A 5-POINT GLOBAL QUALITY SCALE WAS USED (GQS: 1 = POOR QUALITY, 5 = EXCELLENT QUALITY), FOR RELIABILITY A 5-POINT DISCERN SCALE WAS USED, AND FOR CONTENT AN 8-POINT SCALE (HIGHER POINTS INDICATED GREATER RELIABILITY AND BETTER CONTENT). RESULTS: OF THE 200 VIDEOS INITIALLY INCLUDED IN THE STUDY, 33 (37.9%) WERE CLASSIFIED AS USEFUL AND 54 (62%) AS MISLEADING INFORMATION. THE RELIABILITY, CONTENT AND QUALITY SCORES OF THE VIDEOS IN THE USEFUL INFORMATION GROUP WERE HIGHER. THE LENGTH (IN SECONDS) OF THE VIDEOS IN THE USEFUL INFORMATION GROUP (MEDIAN 301, IQR 231Ã¢â‚¬â€œ512) WAS LONGER THAN THAT OF THOSE IN THE MISLEADING INFORMATION GROUP (MEDIAN 163, IQR 94.8Ã¢â‚¬â€œ231) (P = 0.003). THE MAJORITY (70.6%) OF THE VIDEOS IN THE MISLEADING INFORMATION GROUP HAD BEEN UPLOADED BY AN INDIVIDUAL USER. THE NUMBER OF VIEWS PER DAY OF THE VIDEOS IN THE MISLEADING INFORMATION GROUP (MEDIAN 58.6, IQR 18.5Ã¢â‚¬â€œ298) WAS GREATER THAN THAT OF THE VIDEOS IN THE USEFUL INFORMATION GROUP (MEDIAN 49.7, IQR 16.3Ã¢â‚¬â€œ268) (P = 0.276). THE NUMBER OF TOTAL VIEWS WAS HIGHER FOR THE MISLEADING INFORMATION GROUP (MEDIAN 83807 VS. 80237) BUT NOT AT A LEVEL OF STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE (P = 0.153). THERE WERE MORE VIDEOS EXPLAINING BREAST SELF-EXAMINATION DIRECTED AT WOMEN ONLY, AND THERE WERE DETERMINED TO BE FEW VIDEOS INCLUDING MEN ONLY OR BOTH GENDERS. CONCLUSION: ALTHOUGH THERE ARE MANY VIDEOS IN ENGLISH RELATED TO BREAST SELF-EXAMINATION ON YOUTUBE, A GREAT MANY OF THESE CONTAIN MISLEADING INFORMATION. THEREFORE, FOR PUBLIC INFORMATION, THERE IS A NEED FOR VIDEOS WITH FULL AND ACCURATE INFORMATION TO BE MADE BY UNIVERSITIES, HEALTHCARE ORGANISATIONS AND DOCTORS NOT BENEFITTING FROM THE OUTCOMES, TO BE UPLOADED TO YOUTUBE, WHICH IS A CURRENTLY IMPORTANT SOURCE OF INFORMATION FOR THE GENERAL POPULATION.

156,WHO SHARED IT DECIDING WHAT NEWS TO TRUST ON SOCIAL MEDIA,"SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY POPULAR NEWS SOURCES. THEY DIFFER FROM TRADITIONAL MEDIA AS PEOPLE ARE EXPOSED TO STORIES FROM A VARIETY OF PEOPLE AND OUTLETS, INCLUDING POTENTIAL FAKE NEWS STORIES. THIS RAISES A KEY QUESTION: WHAT LEADS PEOPLE TO TRUST NEWS ON SOCIAL MEDIA? RESEARCH INDICATES TWO CUES THAT COULD IMPACT OPINIONS OF NEWS ON SOCIAL MEDIA: (1) THE TRUSTWORTHINESS OF THE PERSON WHO SHARES A STORY; (2) THE CREDIBILITY OF THE NEWS OUTLET REPORTING THE STORY. THIS STUDY TESTS THOSE FACTORS SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH A RECENT SURVEY EXPERIMENT OF AMERICAN ADULTS THAT SIMULATES SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS BY EITHER A TRUSTED OR UNTRUSTED PUBLIC FIGURE AND DIRECTS RESPONDENTS TO AN ARTICLE MANIPULATED TO COME FROM EITHER A REPUTABLE NEWS SOURCE OR A FAKE NEWS SOURCE.

TO ANSWER THIS, WE DRAW UPON DATA FROM SEVENTY-ONE IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS IN CHICAGO, PHILADELPHIA, AND MIAMI. WE FOUND THAT PERCEPTIONS ABOUT THE OVERALL MEDIA ECOSYSTEM WERE CHARACTERIZED BY A: A) NEGATIVE VIEW OF THE CURRENT QUALITY OF NEWS REPORTING, B) PARTICULAR DISTRUST OF NEWS CIRCULATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA; AND C) CONCERN ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF THESE TRENDS MAINLY ON THE INFORMATION HABITS OF OTHERS. TO COUNTER THESE PERCEPTIONS, PARTICIPANTS INDICATED TO RELY ON: A) TRADITIONAL FACT-BASED MEDIA, ACCOMPANIED BY A REJECTION OF OPINIONATED OUTLETS; B) PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE; C) REPETITION OF INFORMATION ACROSS OUTLETS; D) CONSUMPTION OF CROSS-IDEOLOGICAL SOURCES; E) FACT-CHECKING; AND F) TRUST IN CERTAIN PERSONAL CONTACTS ON SOCIAL MEDIA, WHO ARE PERCEIVED AS ASSESSORS OF NEWS QUALITY. OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT: A) NEWS CONSUMPTION IS BEING RITUALIZED IN NEW AND MORE PERSONALIZED WAYS; B) SOCIAL MEDIA IS SEEN AS A GATEWAY TO NEWS PARTLY BECAUSE AUDIENCES FIND OPINION LEADERS IN TERMS OF THEIR SKILLS AS CREDIBILITY ASSESSORS; AND C) JOURNALISM COULD CATER MORE TO AUDIENCESÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ DEMANDS FOR MORE FACT-ORIENTED AND LESS DISCUSSION-BASED CONTENT.

485,MISINFORMATION AND THE US EBOLA COMMUNICATION CRISIS ANALYZING THE VERACITY AND CONTENT OF SOCIAL MEDIA MESSAGES RELATED TO A FEARINDUCING INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK,"BACKGROUND: THE EBOLA COMMUNICATION CRISIS OF 2014 GENERATED WIDESPREAD FEAR AND ATTENTION AMONG WESTERN NEWS MEDIA, SOCIAL MEDIA USERS, AND MEMBERS OF THE UNITED STATES (US) PUBLIC. HEALTH COMMUNICATORS NEED MORE INFORMATION ON MISINFORMATION AND THE SOCIAL MEDIA ENVIRONMENT DURING A FEAR-INDUCING DISEASE OUTBREAK TO IMPROVE COMMUNICATION PRACTICES. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DESCRIBE THE CONTENT OF EBOLA-RELATED TWEETS WITH A SPECIFIC FOCUS ON MISINFORMATION, POLITICAL CONTENT, HEALTH RELATED CONTENT, RISK FRAMING, AND RUMORS. METHODS: WE EXAMINED TWEETS FROM A RANDOM 1% SAMPLE OF ALL TWEETS PUBLISHED SEPTEMBER 30TH-OCTOBER 30TH, 2014, FILTERED FOR ENGLISH-LANGUAGE TWEETS MENTIONING ""EBOLA"" IN THE CONTENT OR HASHTAG, THAT HAD AT LEAST 1 RETWEET (N = 72,775 TWEETS). A RANDOMLY SELECTED SUBSET OF 3639 (5%) TWEETS WERE EVALUATED FOR INCLUSION. WE ANALYZED THE 3113 TWEETS THAT MEET INCLUSION CRITERIA USING PUBLIC HEALTH TRAINED HUMAN CODERS TO ASSESS TWEET CHARACTERISTICS (JOKE, OPINION, DISCORD), VERACITY (TRUE, FALSE, PARTIALLY FALSE), POLITICAL CONTEXT, RISK FRAME, HEALTH CONTEXT, EBOLA SPECIFIC MESSAGES, AND RUMORS. WE ASSESSED THE PROPORTION OF TWEETS WITH SPECIFIC CONTENT USING DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS AND CHI-SQUARED TESTS. RESULTS: OF NON-JOKE TWEETS, 10% OF EBOLA-RELATED TWEETS CONTAINED FALSE OR PARTIALLY FALSE INFORMATION. TWENTY-FIVE PERCENT WERE RELATED TO POLITICS, 28% CONTAINED CONTENT THAT PROVOKED READER RESPONSE OR PROMOTED DISCORD, 42% CONTAINED RISK ELEVATING MESSAGES AND 72% WERE RELATED TO HEALTH. THE MOST FREQUENT RUMOR MENTIONED FOCUSED ON GOVERNMENT CONSPIRACY. WHEN COMPARING TWEETS WITH TRUE INFORMATION TO TWEETS WITH MISINFORMATION, A GREATER PERCENTAGE OF TWEETS WITH MISINFORMATION WERE POLITICAL IN NATURE (36% VS 15%) AND CONTAINED DISCORD-INDUCING STATEMENTS (45% VS 10%). DISCORD-INDUCING STATEMENTS AND POLITICAL MESSAGES WERE BOTH SIGNIFICANTLY MORE COMMON IN TWEETS CONTAINING MISINFORMATION COMPARED WITH THOSE WITHOUT(P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: RESULTS HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF ANTICIPATING POLITICIZATION OF DISEASE OUTBREAKS, AND THE NEED FOR POLICY MAKERS AND SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES TO BUILD PARTNERSHIPS AND DEVELOP RESPONSE FRAMEWORKS IN ADVANCE OF AN EVENT.

96,EPISTEMOLOGY IN THE ERA OF FAKE NEWS AN EXPLORATION OF INFORMATION VERIFICATION BEHAVIORS AMONG SOCIAL NETWORKING SITE USERS,"FAKE NEWS HAS RECENTLY GARNERED INCREASED ATTENTION ACROSS THE WORLD. DIGITAL COLLABORATION TECHNOLOGIES NOW ENABLE INDIVIDUALS TO SHARE INFORMATION AT UNPRECEDENTED RATES TO ADVANCE THEIR OWN IDEOLOGIES. MUCH OF THIS SHARING OCCURS VIA SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES (SNSS), WHOSE MEMBERS MAY CHOOSE TO SHARE INFORMATION WITHOUT CONSIDERATION FOR ITS AUTHENTICITY. THIS RESEARCH ADVANCES OUR UNDERSTANDING OF INFORMATION VERIFICATION BEHAVIORS AMONG SNS USERS IN THE CONTEXT OF FAKE NEWS. GROUNDED IN LITERATURE ON THE EPISTEMOLOGY OF TESTIMONY AND THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVES ON TRUST, WE DEVELOP A NEWS VERIFICATION BEHAVIOR RESEARCH MODEL AND TEST SIX HYPOTHESES WITH A SURVEY OF ACTIVE SNS USERS. THE EMPIRICAL RESULTS CONFIRM THE SIGNIFICANCE OF ALL PROPOSED HYPOTHESES. PERCEPTIONS OF NEWS SHARERSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ NETWORK (PERCEIVED COGNITIVE HOMOGENEITY, SOCIAL TIE VARIETY, AND TRUST), PERCEPTIONS OF NEWS AUTHORS (FAKE NEWS AWARENESS AND PERCEIVED MEDIA CREDIBILITY), AND INNATE INTENTIONS TO SHARE ALL INFLUENCE INFORMATION VERIFICATION BEHAVIORS AMONG SNS MEMBERS.

167,FAKE NEWS IN UROLOGY EVALUATING THE ACCURACY OF ARTICLES SHARED ON SOCIAL MEDIA IN GENITOURINARY MALIGNANCIES,"OBJECTIVES: TO EVALUATE THE ACCURACY OF THE MOST POPULAR ARTICLES ON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS PERTAINING TO GENITOURINARY MALIGNANCIES, AND TO IDENTIFY THE PREVALENCE OF MISINFORMATION AVAILABLE TO PATIENTS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THE 10 MOST SHARED ARTICLES ON POPULAR SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS (FACEBOOK, TWITTER, PINTEREST, AND REDDIT) WERE IDENTIFIED FOR PROSTATE CANCER, BLADDER CANCER, KIDNEY CANCER, TESTIS CANCER, AND PSA TESTING USING A SOCIAL MEDIA ANALYSIS TOOL (AUGUST 2017 AND AUGUST 2018). ARTICLES WERE REVIEWED FOR ACCURACY BY COMPARING THE ARTICLE INFORMATION AGAINST AVAILABLE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND CONSENSUS DATA. THEY WERE CLASSIFIED AS ACCURATE, MISLEADING OR INACCURATE. THE MANNÃ¢â‚¬â€œWHITNEY U-TEST WAS USED FOR STATISTICAL COMPARISON. RESULTS: ARTICLES PERTAINING TO PROSTATE CANCER WERE THE MOST SHARED ACROSS ALL SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS (399Ã‚Â 000 SHARES), FOLLOWED BY ARTICLES PERTAINING TO KIDNEY CANCER (115Ã‚Â 000), BLADDER CANCER (17Ã‚Â 894), PSA TESTING (8827) AND TESTICULAR CANCER (7045). THE PREVALENCE OF INACCURATE OR MISLEADING ARTICLES WAS HIGH: PROSTATE CANCER, 7/10 ARTICLES; KIDNEY, 3/10 ARTICLES; BLADDER, 2/10 ARTICLES; TESTIS, 2/10 ARTICLES; AND PSA TESTING, 1/10 ARTICLES. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER AVERAGE NUMBER OF SHARES FOR INACCURATE (54Ã‚Â 000 SHARES; P < 0.01) AND MISLEADING ARTICLES (7040 SHARES; P < 0.01) THAN FOR ACCURATE ARTICLES (1900 SHARES). INACCURATE ARTICLES WERE 28 TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE SHARED THAN FACTUAL ARTICLES. CONCLUSION: MISLEADING OR INACCURATE INFORMATION ON GENITOURINARY MALIGNANCIES IS COMMONLY SHARED ON SOCIAL MEDIA.

467,GLOBAL INFODEMIOLOGY OF COVID19 ANALYSIS OF GOOGLE WEB SEARCHES AND INSTAGRAM HASHTAGS,"BACKGROUND: ALTHOUGH Ã¢â‚¬Å“INFODEMIOLOGICALÃ¢â‚¬Â METHODS HAVE BEEN USED IN RESEARCH ON CORONAVIRUS DISEASE (COVID-19), AN EXAMINATION OF THE EXTENT OF INFODEMIC MONIKER (MISINFORMATION) USE ON THE INTERNET REMAINS LIMITED. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO INVESTIGATE INTERNET SEARCH BEHAVIORS RELATED TO COVID-19 AND EXAMINE THE CIRCULATION OF INFODEMIC MONIKERS THROUGH TWO PLATFORMS-GOOGLE AND INSTAGRAM-DURING THE CURRENT GLOBAL PANDEMIC. METHODS: WE HAVE DEFINED INFODEMIC MONIKER AS A TERM, QUERY, HASHTAG, OR PHRASE THAT GENERATES OR FEEDS FAKE NEWS, MISINTERPRETATIONS, OR DISCRIMINATORY PHENOMENA. USING GOOGLE TRENDS AND INSTAGRAM HASHTAGS, WE EXPLORED INTERNET SEARCH ACTIVITIES AND BEHAVIORS RELATED TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC FROM FEBRUARY 20, 2020, TO MAY 6, 2020. WE INVESTIGATED THE NAMES USED TO IDENTIFY THE VIRUS, HEALTH AND RISK PERCEPTION, LIFE DURING THE LOCKDOWN, AND INFORMATION RELATED TO THE ADOPTION OF COVID-19 INFODEMIC MONIKERS. WE COMPUTED THE AVERAGE PEAK VOLUME WITH A 95% CI FOR THE MONIKERS. RESULTS: THE TOP SIX COVID-19-RELATED TERMS SEARCHED IN GOOGLE WERE Ã¢â‚¬Å“CORONAVIRUS,Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬Å“CORONA,Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬Å“COVID,Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬Å“VIRUS,Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬Å“CORONA VIRUS,Ã¢â‚¬Â AND Ã¢â‚¬Å“COVID-19.Ã¢â‚¬Â COUNTRIES WITH A HIGHER NUMBER OF COVID-19 CASES HAD A HIGHER NUMBER OF COVID-19 QUERIES ON GOOGLE. THE MONIKERS Ã¢â‚¬Å“CORONAVIRUS OZONE,Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬Å“CORONAVIRUS LABORATORY,Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬Å“CORONAVIRUS 5G,Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬Å“CORONAVIRUS CONSPIRACY,Ã¢â‚¬Â AND Ã¢â‚¬Å“CORONAVIRUS BILL GATESÃ¢â‚¬Â WERE WIDELY CIRCULATED ON THE INTERNET. SEARCHES ON Ã¢â‚¬Å“TIPS AND CURESÃ¢â‚¬Â FOR COVID-19 SPIKED IN RELATION TO THE US PRESIDENT SPECULATING ABOUT A Ã¢â‚¬Å“MIRACLE CUREÃ¢â‚¬Â AND SUGGESTING AN INJECTION OF DISINFECTANT TO TREAT THE VIRUS. AROUND TWO THIRDS (N=48,700,000, 66.1%) OF INSTAGRAM USERS USED THE HASHTAGS Ã¢â‚¬Å“COVID-19Ã¢â‚¬Â AND Ã¢â‚¬Å“CORONAVIRUSÃ¢â‚¬Â TO DISPERSE VIRUS-RELATED INFORMATION. CONCLUSIONS: GLOBALLY, THERE IS A GROWING INTEREST IN COVID-19, AND NUMEROUS INFODEMIC MONIKERS CONTINUE TO CIRCULATE ON THE INTERNET. BASED ON OUR FINDINGS, WE HOPE TO ENCOURAGE MASS MEDIA REGULATORS AND HEALTH ORGANIZERS TO BE VIGILANT AND DIMINISH THE USE AND CIRCULATION OF THESE INFODEMIC MONIKERS TO DECREASE THE SPREAD OF MISINFORMATION.

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: CONTEXTUALIZING THE FAKE NEWS ABOUT COCA-COLAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S RECALL OF DASANI WATER, AN ONLINE SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED VIA QUALTRICS WITH CONSUMERS IN THE USA (N = 468). DATA WERE ANALYZED USING COVARIANCE-BASED STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING. FINDINGS: RESULTS SHOWED THAT SELF-EFFICACY AND MEDIA TRUST SIGNIFICANTLY PREDICTED CONSUMERSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ PERSUASION KNOWLEDGE OF THE FAKE NEWS. PERSUASION KNOWLEDGE OF THE FAKE NEWS SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCED CONSUMERSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ PERCEIVED DIAGNOSTICITY OF THE FAKE NEWS AND SUBSEQUENT BRAND TRUST. FURTHERMORE, PERSUASION KNOWLEDGE OF THE FAKE NEWS MEDIATED THE EFFECTS FROM SELF-EFFICACY ON PERCEIVED DIAGNOSTICITY OF THE FAKE NEWS AND BRAND TRUST, RESPECTIVELY. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: THIS STUDY CONTRIBUTES TO THE LITERATURE OF BRAND MANAGEMENT BY EXAMINING HOW CONSUMERS PROCESS AND RESPOND TO FAKE NEWS ABOUT A BRAND. IT ALSO EXTENDS THE PERSUASION KNOWLEDGE MODEL BY APPLYING IT TO THE CONTEXT OF FAKE NEWS ABOUT BRANDS ON SOCIAL MEDIA, AND INCORPORATING ANTECEDENTS (SELF-EFFICACY AND MEDIA TRUST) AND CONSEQUENCES (PERCEIVED DIAGNOSTICITY AND BRAND TRUST) OF PERSUASION KNOWLEDGE IN THIS PARTICULAR CONTEXT.

67,HOW SOCIAL MEDIA CONSTRUCT TRUTH AROUND CRISIS EVENTS WEIBOS RUMOR MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES AFTER THE 2015 TIANJIN BLASTS,"CHINA'S CONTROL OF INFORMATION ONLINE IS OFTEN IMPOSED BY SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS IN THE NAME OF Ã¢â‚¬Å“RUMOR MANAGEMENT.Ã¢â‚¬Â THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE CONTENT MODERATION STRATEGIES OF SINA WEIBO, CHINA'S LARGEST MICROBLOGGING PLATFORM, IN REGULATING DISCUSSION OF RUMORS FOLLOWING THE 2015 TIANJIN BLASTS. MORE THAN 100,000 WEIBO POSTS WERE COLLECTED AND CATEGORIZED INTO THREE DATA SETS: RUMOR DISCUSSION POSTS FROM THE PUBLIC, RUMOR-DEBUNKING POSTS FROM WEIBO'S OFFICIAL RUMOR REBUTTAL ACCOUNTS, AND POSTS REMOVED FROM THE SYSTEM. TWO CONTENT-MODERATION RUMOR STRATEGIES, NAMELY RUMOR REBUTTAL AND CONTENT REMOVAL, WERE IDENTIFIED. CLUSTERING ANALYSIS AND TIME SERIES ANALYSIS WAS APPLIED TO TEST HOW THESE TWO STRATEGIES WERE USED TO FILTER POSTS OF DIFFERENT TOPICS AND HOW THEY WERE ASSOCIATED WITH PUBLIC DISCUSSION OF RUMOR-RELATED TOPICS. OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT THE PLATFORM'S RESPONSE TO RUMOR VARIED DEPENDING ON THE POLITICAL SENSITIVITY OF THE TOPIC. TIME-SERIES ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF BOTH STRATEGIES WAS USUALLY ASSOCIATED WITH A SUBSEQUENT INCREASE IN GENERAL DISCUSSION ABOUT THE RUMOR, SUGGESTING THAT THESE STRATEGIES DO NOT CREATE A CONSISTENT CHILLING EFFECT ON PUBLIC SPEECH.

618,CONSPIRACY IN THE TIME OF CORONA AUTOMATIC DETECTION OF EMERGING COVID19 CONSPIRACY THEORIES IN SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE NEWS,"RUMORS AND CONSPIRACY THEORIES THRIVE IN ENVIRONMENTS OF LOW CONFIDENCE AND LOW TRUST. CONSEQUENTLY, IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT ONES RELATED TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ARE PROLIFERATING GIVEN THE LACK OF SCIENTIFIC CONSENSUS ON THE VIRUS'S SPREAD AND CONTAINMENT, OR ON THE LONG-TERM SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC RAMIFICATIONS OF THE PANDEMIC. AMONG THE STORIES CURRENTLY CIRCULATING IN US-FOCUSED SOCIAL MEDIA FORUMS ARE ONES SUGGESTING THAT THE 5G TELECOMMUNICATION NETWORK ACTIVATES THE VIRUS, THAT THE PANDEMIC IS A HOAX PERPETRATED BY A GLOBAL CABAL, THAT THE VIRUS IS A BIO-WEAPON RELEASED DELIBERATELY BY THE CHINESE, OR THAT BILL GATES IS USING IT AS COVER TO LAUNCH A BROAD VACCINATION PROGRAM TO FACILITATE A GLOBAL SURVEILLANCE REGIME. WHILE SOME MAY BE QUICK TO DISMISS THESE STORIES AS HAVING LITTLE IMPACT ON REAL-WORLD BEHAVIOR, RECENT EVENTS INCLUDING THE DESTRUCTION OF CELL PHONE TOWERS, RACIALLY FUELED ATTACKS AGAINST ASIAN AMERICANS, DEMONSTRATIONS ESPOUSING RESISTANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH ORDERS, AND WIDE-SCALE DEFIANCE OF SCIENTIFICALLY SOUND PUBLIC MANDATES SUCH AS THOSE TO WEAR MASKS AND PRACTICE SOCIAL DISTANCING, COUNTERMAND SUCH CONCLUSIONS. INSPIRED BY NARRATIVE THEORY, WE CRAWL SOCIAL MEDIA SITES AND NEWS REPORTS AND, THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF AUTOMATED MACHINE-LEARNING METHODS, DISCOVER THE UNDERLYING NARRATIVE FRAMEWORKS SUPPORTING THE GENERATION OF RUMORS AND CONSPIRACY THEORIES. WE SHOW HOW THE VARIOUS NARRATIVE FRAMEWORKS FUELING THESE STORIES RELY ON THE ALIGNMENT OF OTHERWISE DISPARATE DOMAINS OF KNOWLEDGE, AND CONSIDER HOW THEY ATTACH TO THE BROADER REPORTING ON THE PANDEMIC. THESE ALIGNMENTS AND ATTACHMENTS, WHICH CAN BE MONITORED IN NEAR REAL TIME, MAY BE USEFUL FOR IDENTIFYING AREAS IN THE NEWS THAT ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO REINTERPRETATION BY CONSPIRACY THEORISTS.

5,TOWARDS COMBATING RUMORS IN SOCIAL NETWORKS MODELS AND METRICS,"RUMOR IS A POTENTIALLY HARMFUL SOCIAL PHENOMENON THAT HAS BEEN OBSERVED IN ALL HUMAN SOCIETIES IN ALL TIMES. SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES PROVIDE A PLATFORM FOR THE RAPID INTERCHANGE OF INFORMATION AND HENCE, FOR THE RAPID DISSEMINATION OF UNSUBSTANTIATED CLAIMS THAT ARE POTENTIALLY HARMFUL. IN THIS PAPER, WE STUDY DIFFERENT METHODS FOR COMBATING RUMORS IN SOCIAL NETWORKS ACTUATED BY THE REALIZATION THAT AUTHORITARIAN METHODS FOR FIGHTING RUMOR HAVE LARGELY FAILED. OUR MAJOR INSIGHT IS THAT IN SITUATIONS WHERE POPULATIONS DO NOT ANSWER TO THE SAME AUTHORITY, IT IS THE TRUST THAT INDIVIDUALS PLACE IN THEIR FRIENDS THAT MUST BE LEVERAGED TO FIGHT RUMOR. IN OTHER WORDS, RUMOR IS BEST COMBATED BY SOMETHING WHICH ACTS LIKE ITSELF, A MESSAGE WHICH SPREADS FROM ONE INDIVIDUAL TO ANOTHER. WE CALL SUCH MESSAGES ANTI-RUMORS. WE STUDY THREE NATURAL ANTI-RUMOR PROCESSES TO COUNTER THE RUMOR AND PRESENT MEAN FIELD EQUATIONS THAT CHARACTERIZE THE SYSTEM. SEVERAL METRICS ARE PROPOSED TO CAPTURE THE PROPERTIES OF RUMOR AND ANTI-RUMOR PROCESSES. THE METRICS ARE GEARED TO CAPTURE TEMPORAL EVOLUTION AS WELL AS GLOBAL PROPERTIES OF THE PROCESSES.

DESPITE THE ADVANTAGES OFFERED BY THESE SERVICES ON SUPPLYING INFORMATION IN VAGUE SITUATION BY CITIZEN, WE RAISED THE ISSUE OF SPREADING MISINFORMATION ON TWITTER BY USING RETWEETS. ACCORDINGLY, IN THIS STUDY, WE CONDUCT A USER SURVEY (N = 133) TO INVESTIGATE WHAT IS THE USERÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S ACTION TOWARDS SPREAD MESSAGE IN TWITTER, AND WHY USER DECIDE TO PERFORM RETWEET ON THE SPREAD MESSAGE. AS THE RESULT OF THE FACTOR ANALYSES, WE EXTRACTED 3 FACTORS ON USERÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S ACTION TOWARDS SPREAD MESSAGE WHICH ARE: 1) DESIRE TO SPREAD THE RETWEET MESSAGES AS IT IS CONSIDERED IMPORTANT, 2) MARK THE RETWEET MESSAGES AS FAVORITE USING TWITTER Ã¢â‚¬Å“FAVORITEÃ¢â‚¬Â FUNCTION, AND 3) SEARCH FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE CONTENT OF THE RETWEET MESSAGES. THEN, WE FURTHER ANALYZE WHY USER DECIDES TO PERFORM RETWEET. THE RESULTS REVEAL THAT USER HAS DESIRE TO SPREAD THE MESSAGE WHICH THEY THINK IS IMPORTANT AND THE REASON WHY THEY RETWEET IT IS BECAUSE OF THE NEED TO RETWEET, INTERESTING TWEET CONTENT AND THE TWEET USER.

THIS STUDY TESTED THE EFFECT OF TWO SIMPLE INTERVENTIONS, BOTH OF WHICH PRIMED CRITICAL THINKING, ON INDIVIDUALSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ EVALUATION OF THE CREDIBILITY OF REAL AND FAKE NEWS ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE ON FACEBOOK. THROUGH AN ONLINE EXPERIMENT (N = 2,750 PARTICIPANTS), PARTICIPANTS EITHER READ A SERIES OF GUIDELINES FOR EVALUATING NEWS ONLINE, OR READ AND THEN RATED THE IMPORTANCE OF EACH GUIDELINE; A CONTROL GROUP WAS NOT EXPOSED TO GUIDELINES OF ANY TYPE. WE FOUND THAT PARTICIPANTS EXPOSED TO BOTH TYPES OF GUIDELINES REPORTED A REDUCED LIKELIHOOD TO TRUST, LIKE, AND SHARE FAKE NEWS ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE ON FACEBOOK. IMPORTANTLY, EXPOSURE TO THESE GUIDELINES DID NOT DIMINISH INDIVIDUALSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ LIKELIHOOD TO TRUST, LIKE, OR SHARE LEGITIMATE CLIMATE NEWS. THE EFFECT SIZES FOR BOTH TYPES OF INTERVENTION WERE SMALL. HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF THE SCALE AND SPEED AT WHICH SOCIAL MEDIA OPERATES, EVEN A SMALL REDUCTION IN USERSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ LIKELIHOOD TO TRUST, LIKE, AND SHARE FAKE NEWS COULD BE MEANINGFUL AND IMPACTFUL.

THIS STUDY FOCUSES ON TWITTER USERS IN THE CONTEXT OF A CRISIS IN THE NETHERLANDS ON JANUARY 29, 2015. AFTER HAVING MADE A BOMB THREAT, AN ARMED MAN MANAGED TO GET ACCESS TO THE NATIONAL NEWS BROADCASTING STATION AROUND 8 PM, WHERE HE DEMANDED AIRPLAY TO SHARE ""AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE"" WITH DUTCH CITIZENS. THREE WEEKS AFTER THE TERRORIST ATTACK ON CHARLIE HEBDO IN PARIS, APPROXIMATELY 1.5 MILLION VIEWERS WERE ANXIOUS THAT A SIMILAR ATTACK WAS TAKING PLACE IN THE TELEVISION STUDIO. THE CRISIS, ALSO FOLLOWED BY SOCIAL MEDIA USERS, REACHED A CLIMAX WHEN ARMED POLICEMEN ARRESTED THE MAN, WHICH WAS LATER SHOWN ON NATIONAL TV. WE ANALYZED 58,931 TWEETS, POSTED IN THE SIX HOURS AFTER THE INCIDENT. BY EXAMINING SHARED FACTS AND RUMORS DURING THE GUNMAN CRISIS, WE IDENTIFIED AN ""ECHO-EFFECT"": THE DISSEMINATION OF OLDER TWEETS CONTINUED AFTER THE POSTING OF NEW FACTS BY THE SAME SOURCE.

THE WIDESPREAD ATTENTION ON DETECTING AND CHARACTERIZING DECEPTIVE INFORMATION HAS BEEN MOTIVATED BY CONSIDERABLE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL BACKLASHES IN THE REAL WORLD. AS A MATTER OF FACT, SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS EXHIBIT PECULIAR CHARACTERISTICS, WITH RESPECT TO TRADITIONAL NEWS OUTLETS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY FAVORABLE TO THE PROLIFERATION OF FALSE NEWS. THEY ALSO PRESENT UNIQUE CHALLENGES FOR ALL KIND OF POTENTIAL INTERVENTIONS ON THE SUBJECT. AS THIS ISSUE BECOMES OF GLOBAL CONCERN, IT IS ALSO GAINING MORE ATTENTION IN ACADEMIA. THE AIM OF THIS SURVEY IS TO OFFER A COMPREHENSIVE STUDY ON THE RECENT ADVANCES IN TERMS OF DETECTION, CHARACTERIZATION AND MITIGATION OF FALSE NEWS THAT PROPAGATE ON SOCIAL MEDIA, AS WELL AS THE CHALLENGES AND THE OPEN QUESTIONS THAT AWAIT FUTURE RESEARCH ON THE FIELD. WE USE A DATA-DRIVEN APPROACH, FOCUSING ON A CLASSIFICATION OF THE FEATURES THAT ARE USED IN EACH STUDY TO CHARACTERIZE FALSE INFORMATION AND ON THE DATASETS USED FOR INSTRUCTING CLASSIFICATION METHODS.

129,THE ABSENCE OF EVIDENCE IS EVIDENCE OF NONSENSE CROSSSECTIONAL STUDY ON THE QUALITY OF PSORIASISRELATED VIDEOS ON YOUTUBE AND THEIR RECEPTION BY HEALTH SEEKERS,"BACKGROUND: APPROXIMATELY 80% OF INTERNET USERS ACCESS HEALTH INFORMATION ONLINE AND PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC ILLNESSES ESPECIALLY RELY ON INTERNET-BASED RESOURCES. YOUTUBE RANKS SECOND AMONG THE MOST ACCESSED WEBSITES WORLDWIDE AND HOSTS AN INCREASING NUMBER OF VIDEOS WITH MEDICAL INFORMATION. HOWEVER, THEIR QUALITY IS SOMETIMES UNSCIENTIFIC, MISLEADING, OR EVEN HARMFUL. OBJECTIVE: AS LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT YOUTUBE AS A SOURCE OF INFORMATION ON PSORIASIS, WE AIMED TO INVESTIGATE THE QUALITY OF PSORIASIS-RELATED VIDEOS AND, IF NECESSARY, POINT OUT STRATEGIES FOR THEIR IMPROVEMENT. METHODS: THE QUALITY OF THE 100 MOST VIEWED PSORIASIS-RELATED VIDEOS WAS ASSESSED USING THE DISCERN INSTRUMENT AND THE GLOBAL QUALITY SCALE (GQS) BY CATEGORIZING THE VIDEOS INTO USEFUL, MISLEADING, AND DANGEROUS AND BY EVALUATING THE RECEPTION OF THE VIDEOS BY USERS. RESULTS: EVALUATION OF THE VIDEOS EXHIBITED A TOTAL OF 117,221,391 VIEWS AND A TOTAL DURATION OF 10:28 HOUR. THE MAJORITY OF CLIPS CONTAINED ANECDOTAL PERSONAL EXPERIENCES WITH COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE PSORIASIS TREATMENTS, TOPICAL TREATMENTS, AND NUTRITION AND DIETS BEING THE MOST FREQUENTLY ADDRESSED TOPICS. WHILE ADVERTISEMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR 26.0% (26/100) OF THE VIDEOS, EVIDENCE-BASED HEALTH INFORMATION AMOUNTED TO ONLY 20.0% (20/100); 32.0% (32/100) OF THE VIDEOS WERE CLASSIFIED AS USEFUL, 52.0% (52/100) AS MISLEADING, AND 11.0% (11/100) AS EVEN DANGEROUS. THE QUALITY OF THE VIDEOS EVALUATED BY DISCERN AND GQS WAS GENERALLY LOW (1.87 AND 1.95, RESPECTIVELY, ON A 1 TO 5 SCALE WITH 5 BEING THE MAXIMUM). MOREOVER, WE FOUND THAT VIEWERS RATED POOR-QUALITY VIDEOS BETTER THAN HIGHER QUALITY VIDEOS. CONCLUSIONS: OUR IN-DEPTH STUDY DEMONSTRATES THAT NEARLY TWO-THIRDS OF THE PSORIASIS-RELATED VIDEOS WE ANALYZED DISSEMINATE MISLEADING OR EVEN DANGEROUS CONTENT. SUBJECTIVE ANECDOTAL AND UNSCIENTIFIC CONTENT IS DISPROPORTIONATELY OVERREPRESENTED AND POOR-QUALITY VIDEOS ARE PREDOMINANTLY RATED POSITIVELY BY USERS, WHILE HIGHER QUALITY VIDEO CLIPS RECEIVE LESS POSITIVE RATINGS. STRATEGIES BY PROFESSIONAL DERMATOLOGICAL ORGANIZATIONS ARE URGENTLY NEEDED TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF INFORMATION ON PSORIASIS ON YOUTUBE AND OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA.

TO THIS AIM WE COLLECTED A LARGE-SCALE DATASET OF TWEETS ASSOCIATED TO THOUSANDS OF NEWS ARTICLES PUBLISHED ON ITALIAN DISINFORMATION WEBSITES. IN THE OBSERVATION PERIOD, A FEW OUTLETS ACCOUNTED FOR MOST OF THE DECEPTIVE INFORMATION CIRCULATING ON TWITTER, WHICH FOCUSED ON CONTROVERSIAL AND POLARIZING TOPICS OF DEBATE SUCH AS IMMIGRATION, NATIONAL SAFETY AND (ITALIAN) NATIONALISM.

612,EFFECTS OF VACCINERELATED CONSPIRACY THEORIES ON CHINESE YOUNG ADULTS PERCEPTIONS OF THE HPV VACCINE AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY,"THIS ONLINE EXPERIMENT USED THE THEORY OF PLANNED BEHAVIOR TO EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF EXPOSURE TO CONSPIRACY SOCIAL MEDIA MESSAGES ON CHINESE YOUNG ADULTS' PERCEPTIONS OF THE HPV VACCINE. THREE MAJOR FINDINGS WERE IDENTIFIED. FIRST, EXPOSURE TO ANTI-VACCINE CONSPIRACY THEORIES RESULTED IN LESS FAVORABLE ATTITUDES TOWARD THE HPV VACCINE, LESS POSITIVE PERCEIVED NORMS REGARDING GETTING VACCINATED, AND WEAKER VACCINATION INTENTIONS. SECOND, PEOPLE WHO WERE MORE KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THE HPV VACCINE HAD MORE FAVORABLE ATTITUDES, MORE POSITIVE NORMS, HIGHER PERCEIVED BEHAVIORAL CONTROL, AND GREATER BEHAVIORAL INTENTIONS. FINALLY, VACCINE KNOWLEDGE MODERATED THE EFFECT OF EXPOSURE TO ANTI-VACCINE CONSPIRACY THEORIES. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT, AMONG CHINESE YOUNG ADULT SOCIAL MEDIA USERS, PREEXISTING KNOWLEDGE OF THE HPV VACCINE MAY HAVE A PROTECTIVE EFFECT AGAINST EXPOSURE TO ONLINE CONSPIRACY THEORIES.",NA,PLANNED BEHAVIOR; HEALTH; MISINFORMATION; COMMUNICATION; KNOWLEDGE; IMPACT; INFORMATION; INTENTIONS; PREVENTION; CRITICISM,2021,https://doi.org/10.1080/10410236.2020.1751384,5,8,1,0,0,USA,HEALTH COMMUNICATION
104,FAKE NEWS INFLUENCERS AND HEALTHRELATED PROFESSIONAL PARTICIPATION ON THE WEB A PILOT STUDY ON A SOCIALNETWORK OF PEOPLE WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS,"BACKGROUND: OVER THE LAST FEW DECADES, PATIENTS HAVE INCREASINGLY BEEN SEARCHING FOR HEALTH INFORMATION ON THE INTERNET. THIS ASPECT OF INFORMATION SEEKING IS IMPORTANT, ESPECIALLY FOR PEOPLE AFFECTED BY CHRONIC PATHOLOGIES AND REQUIRE LIFELONG TREATMENT AND MANAGEMENT. THESE PEOPLE ARE USUALLY VERY WELL INFORMED ABOUT THE DISEASE BUT ARE NONETHELESS VULNERABLE TO HOPES OF BEING CURED OR SAVED, OFTEN AMPLIFIED BY MISINFORMATION, MYTHS, LEGENDS, AND THERAPIES THAT ARE NOT ALWAYS SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN. MANY STUDIES SUGGEST THAT SOME INDIVIDUALS PREFER TO RELY ON THE INTERNET AS THEIR MAIN SOURCE OF INFORMATION, OFTEN HINDERING THE PATIENT-DOCTOR RELATIONSHIP. A PROFESSIONAL APPROACH IS IMPERATIVE TO MAINTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY, HONESTY, AND TRUST IN THE MEDICAL PROFESSION. OBJECTIVE: WE AIMED TO EXAMINE, IN A MEDICALLY SUPERVISED ITALIAN WEB COMMUNITY (SMSOCIALNETWOTK.COM) DEDICATED TO PEOPLE WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (PWMS), THE POSTS SHARED BY USERS AND TO VERIFY THE RELIABILITY OF CONTENTS OF POSTS SHARED BY USERS PINPOINTED AS INFLUENCERS THROUGH AN ONLINE QUESTIONNAIRE. METHODS: WE GROUPED THE POSTS PUBLISHED ON SMSOCIALNETWORK FROM APRIL TO JUNE 2015 INTO THOSE WITH MEDICAL CONTENT (SCIENTIFICALLY CORRECT OR FAKE NEWS), AND THOSE RELATED TO SOCIAL INTERACTIONS. LATER, WE GAVE A QUESTIONNAIRE TO THE COMMUNITY ASKING TO IDENTIFY THE THREE USERS/INFLUENCERS PROVIDING THE MOST RELIABLE ADVICE FOR EVERYDAY LIFE WITH MS AND THE THREE USERS/INFLUENCERS PROVIDING THE MOST USEFUL INFORMATION ABOUT MS TREATMENTS. RESULTS: 308 POSTS REPORTED SCIENTIFIC AND RELEVANT MEDICAL INFORMATION, WHEREAS 72 POSTS INCLUDED PIECES OF FAKE NEWS. 1420 POSTS WERE OF GENERAL INTEREST. FOUR OUT OF THE 6 INFLUENCERS HAD WRITTEN ONLY POSTS WITH CORRECT MEDICAL INFORMATION (3 WERE PWMS, 1 WAS A NEUROLOGIST) AND NEVER ANY FAKE NEWS. THE REMAINING 2 APPOINTED INFLUENCERS (2 PWMS) HAD WRITTEN ONLY POSTS ABOUT GENERAL INTERESTS. CONCLUSION: THE IDENTIFICATION OF FAKE NEWS AND THEIR AUTHORS HAS SHOWN THAT THE LATTER ARE NEVER APPOINTED AS INFLUENCERS. SMSOCIALNETWORK.COM ACTED AS A Ã¢â‚¬Å“WEB SAFE ENVIRONMENTÃ¢â‚¬Â WHERE THE INFLUENCERS CONTRIBUTED BY SHARING ONLY CORRECT MEDICAL INFORMATION AND NEVER FAKE NEWS. WE SPECULATE THAT THE PRESENCE OF NEUROLOGISTS AND PSYCHOLOGISTS SUPERVISING THE INFORMATION FLOW MIGHT HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO REDUCE THE RISK OF FAKE NEWS SPREADING AND TO AVOID THEIR ACQUISITION OF AUTHORITATIVE MEANING.

WITH RELATED POLICY INTERVENTIONS DEPENDENT ON VERIFIABLE EVIDENCE, PANDEMICS REQUIRE GOVERNMENTS TO NOT ONLY CONSIDER THE INPUT OF EXPERTS BUT ALSO ENSURE THAT SCIENCE IS TRANSLATED FOR PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING. HOWEVER, MISINFORMATION AND FAKE NEWS, INCLUDING CONTENT SHARED THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA, COMPROMISE THE EFFICACY OF EVIDENCE-BASED POLICY INTERVENTIONS AND UNDERMINE THE CREDIBILITY OF SCIENTIFIC EXPERTISE WITH POTENTIALLY LONGER-TERM CONSEQUENCES. WE INTRODUCE A FORMAL MATHEMATICAL MODEL TO UNDERSTAND FACTORS INFLUENCING THE BEHAVIOR OF SOCIAL MEDIA USERS WHEN ENCOUNTERING FAKE NEWS. THE MODEL ILLUSTRATES THAT DIRECT EFFORTS BY SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS AND GOVERNMENTS, ALONG WITH INFORMAL PRESSURE FROM SOCIAL NETWORKS, CAN REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT USERS WHO ENCOUNTER FAKE NEWS EMBRACE AND FURTHER CIRCULATE IT.

A 3 (LABEL: NONE VS. NEWS VS. RUMOR) Ãƒâ€” 2 (VALENCE: POSITIVE VS. NEGATIVE) ONLINE SEMI-EXPERIMENT, WITH A SURVEY TO MEASURE HEALTH ANXIETY AND HEALTH LITERACY, SHOWED THE FOLLOWING RESULTS: FIRST, PERCEIVED MESSAGE IMPORTANCE MEDIATED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MESSAGE FACTORS AND BEHAVIORAL INTENTIONS: ONLY IN THE CONDITION OF THE NEGATIVE MESSAGE, PARTICIPANTS CONSIDERED A NEWS-LABELED MESSAGE MORE IMPORTANT THAN A RUMORÃ¢â‚¬â€œLABELED OR A NO-LABEL MESSAGE. PERCEIVED MESSAGE IMPORTANCE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH INTENTIONS TO VERIFY AND SHARE THE MESSAGE. SECOND, HEALTH ANXIETY INTERACTED WITH PERCEIVED MESSAGE IMPORTANCE ONLY WHEN PREDICTING AN INTENTION TO SHARE THE MESSAGE. LAST, HEALTHY LITERACY INTERACTED WITH PERCEIVED MESSAGE IMPORTANCE WHEN PREDICTING INTENTIONS TO BOTH VERIFY AND SHARE THE MESSAGE. THE RESULTS WILL PROVIDE IMPLICATIONS FOR HEALTH COMMUNICATION RESEARCH AND PRACTICES, ESPECIALLY ON MANAGING AND CONTROLLING RUMOR DISSEMINATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA.

ALTHOUGH PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF MISINFORMATION AND CORRECTIVE EFFORTS, WE KNOW TOO LITTLE ABOUT THE ROLE OF VISUALS IN DISINFORMATION AND FACT CHECKING. AGAINST THIS BACKDROP, WE CONDUCTED AN ONLINE EXPERIMENT WITH A DIVERSE SAMPLE OF U.S. CITIZENS (N =Ã‚Â 1,404) TO INVESTIGATE THE CREDIBILITY OF TEXTUAL VERSUS MULTIMODAL (TEXT-PLUS-VISUAL) DISINFORMATION, AND THE EFFECTS OF TEXTUAL AND MULTIMODAL FACT CHECKERS IN REFUTING DISINFORMATION ON SCHOOL SHOOTINGS AND REFUGEES. OUR FINDINGS INDICATE THAT, IRRESPECTIVE OF THE SOURCE, MULTIMODAL DISINFORMATION IS CONSIDERED SLIGHTLY MORE CREDIBLE THAN TEXTUAL DISINFORMATION. FACT CHECKERS CAN HELP TO OVERCOME THE POTENTIAL HARMFUL CONSEQUENCES OF DISINFORMATION. WE ALSO FOUND THAT FACT CHECKERS CAN OVERCOME PARTISAN AND ATTITUDINAL FILTERSÃ¢â‚¬â€œWHICH POINTS TO THE RELEVANCE OF FACT CHECKING AS A JOURNALISTIC DISCIPLINE. Ã‚Â© 2020, Ã‚Â© 2020 THE AUTHOR(S).

146,YOUTUBE VIDEOS AS A SOURCE OF MISINFORMATION ON IDIOPATHIC PULMONARY FIBROSIS,"RATIONALE: PATIENTS FREQUENTLY USE YOUTUBE AS A PLATFORM FOR DISSEMINATION AND CONSUMPTION OF HEALTH INFORMATION. CAREGIVERS AND PATIENTS AFFECTED BY IDIOPATHIC PULMONARY FIBROSIS (IPF) ARE LIKELY CONSUMERS OF THIS INFORMATION. OBJECTIVES: WE AIMED TO DETERMINE VIEWER ENGAGEMENT, QUALITY, AND CONTENT OF YOUTUBE VIDEOS ON IPF AND TO COMPARE THE PROVIDED INFORMATION WITH CONTEMPORANEOUS GUIDELINES. METHODS: WE ANALYZED THE FIRST 200 YOUTUBE VIDEOS RESULTING FROM THE SEARCH TERM Ã¢â‚¬Å“IDIOPATHIC PULMONARY FIBROSIS.Ã¢â‚¬Â PATIENT-DIRECTED VIDEOS CONTAINING ANY INFORMATION ON IPF WERE ELIGIBLE. EACH VIDEO WAS EVALUATED FOR CONTENT RELATED TO IPF FEATURES AND TREATMENTS THAT ARE DISCUSSED IN CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES, AS WELL AS NONRECOMMENDED TREATMENTS. VIDEO QUALITY WAS ASSESSED USING AN ADAPTED HEALTH ON THE NET FOUNDATION CODE OF CONDUCT (HONCODE) SCORING INSTRUMENT AND THE VALIDATED DISCERN INSTRUMENT (A QUESTIONNAIRE THAT EVALUATES THE QUALITY OF CONSUMER HEALTH INFORMATION). DETAILS OF THE VIDEO SOURCE AND VIEWER ENGAGEMENT METRICS WERE RECORDED FOR EACH VIDEO. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 102 VIDEOS MET ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA. NO VIDEOS ASSESSED ALL CONTENT TOPICS, WITH VIDEOS ADDRESSING A MEDIAN OF 17% OF ALL POTENTIAL CONTENT ITEMS THAT WERE HIGHLIGHTED IN CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES. CONTENT SCORES WERE HIGHER IN VIDEOS PRODUCED BY FOUNDATIONS AND MEDICAL ORGANIZATIONS, NEWS/MEDIA ORGANIZATIONS, AND INDEPENDENT MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS COMPARED WITH VIDEOS PRODUCED BY INDUSTRY, FOR-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS, AND INDEPENDENT NONMEDICAL USERS. NONRECOMMENDED AND/OR POTENTIALLY HARMFUL THERAPIES WERE DESCRIBED AS VALID AND POTENTIALLY BENEFICIAL TREATMENTS FOR IPF IN 17% OF VIDEOS, WITH HIGHER VIEWERSHIP AND ENGAGEMENT METRICS FOR THESE VIDEOS. HONCODE AND DISCERN SCORES THAT ASSESSED FOR VIDEO RELIABILITY, CREDIBILITY, AND QUALITY OF INFORMATION, WERE POOR FOR ALL VIDEO SOURCE TYPES BUT WERE LOWER IN VIDEOS POSTED BY INDUSTRY/FOR PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS AND INDEPENDENT NONMEDICAL USERS. CONCLUSIONS: PATIENT-DIRECTED YOUTUBE VIDEOS ON IPF FREQUENTLY PROVIDE INCOMPLETE AND INACCURATE INFORMATION. VIDEOS SUPPORTING THE USE OF NONRECOMMENDED THERAPIES HAVE HIGHER VIEWING NUMBERS AND USER ENGAGEMENT, HIGHLIGHTING THE POTENTIAL RISKS OF USING YOUTUBE AS A RESOURCE FOR HEALTH INFORMATION. PHYSICIANS, PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, AND PATIENT SUPPORT ORGANIZATIONS SHOULD BE AWARE THAT YOUTUBE IS FREQUENTLY USED BY PATIENTS. DEVELOPING A TOOL SIMILAR TO HONCODE THAT APPLIES TO YOUTUBE VIDEOS WOULD IMPROVE THE ABILITY TO CRITICALLY AND RAPIDLY APPRAISE THE QUALITY OF ONLINE VIDEO-DISSEMINATED INFORMATION ON IPF.

165,SPREADING DISINFORMATION ON FACEBOOK DO TRUST IN MESSAGE SOURCE RISK PROPENSITY OR PERSONALITY AFFECT THE ORGANIC REACH OF FAKE NEWS,"THERE IS CONSIDERABLE CONCERN ABOUT THE PROPAGATION OF DISINFORMATION THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA, PARTICULARLY FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES. Ã¢â‚¬Å“ORGANIC REACHÃ¢â‚¬Â HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE IMPORTANT IN THE PROPAGATION OF DISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL NETWORKS. THIS IS THE PHENOMENON WHEREBY SOCIAL MEDIA USERS EXTEND THE AUDIENCE FOR A PIECE OF INFORMATION: INTERACTING WITH IT, OR SHARING IT WITH THEIR WIDER NETWORKS, GREATLY INCREASES THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THE INFORMATION REACHES. THIS PROJECT EVALUATED THE EXTENT TO WHICH CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MESSAGE SOURCE (HOW TRUSTWORTHY THEY WERE) AND THE RECIPIENT (RISK PROPENSITY AND PERSONALITY) INFLUENCED THE ORGANIC REACH OF A POTENTIALLY FALSE MESSAGE. IN AN ONLINE STUDY, 357 FACEBOOK USERS COMPLETED PERSONALITY AND RISK PROPENSITY SCALES AND RATED THEIR LIKELIHOOD OF INTERACTING IN VARIOUS WAYS WITH A MESSAGE POSTED BY EITHER A TRUSTWORTHY OR UNTRUSTWORTHY SOURCE. MESSAGE SOURCE IMPACTED ON OVERALL ORGANIC REACH, WITH MESSAGES FROM TRUSTED SOURCES BEING MORE LIKELY TO BE PROPAGATED. RISK PROPENSITY DID NOT INFLUENCE REACH. HOWEVER, LOW SCORES ON TRAIT AGREEABLENESS PREDICTED GREATER LIKELIHOOD OF INTERACTING WITH A MESSAGE. THE FINDINGS PROVIDE PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE THAT BOTH MESSAGE SOURCE AND RECIPIENT CHARACTERISTICS CAN POTENTIALLY INFLUENCE THE SPREAD OF DISINFORMATION.

THIS PAPER CONTRIBUTES TO THE SMALL BODY OF KNOWLEDGE ON THE FIRST POINT (DOMESTIC AUTOMATION AND OPINION MANIPULATION) AND PRESENTS THE FIRST PIECE OF RESEARCH INTO THE SECOND (INTERNATIONAL AUTOMATION AND OPINION MANIPULATION). FINDINGS ARE BASED ON AN ANALYSIS OF 1.5 MILLION COMMENTS ON OFFICIAL POLITICAL INFORMATION POSTS ON WEIBO AND 1.1 MILLION POSTS USING HASHTAGS ASSOCIATED WITH CHINA AND CHINESE POLITICS ON TWITTER. IN LINE WITH PREVIOUS RESEARCH, LITTLE EVIDENCE OF AUTOMATION WAS FOUND ON WEIBO. IN CONTRAST, A LARGE AMOUNT OF AUTOMATION WAS FOUND ON TWITTER. HOWEVER, CONTRARY TO EXPECTATIONS AND PREVIOUS NEWS REPORTS, NO EVIDENCE WAS FOUND OF PRO-CHINESE-STATE AUTOMATION ON TWITTER. AUTOMATION ON TWITTER WAS ASSOCIATED WITH ANTI-CHINESE-STATE PERSPECTIVES AND PUBLISHED IN SIMPLIFIED MANDARIN, PRESUMABLY AIMED AT DIASPORIC CHINESE AND MAINLAND USERS WHO Ã¢â‚¬ËœJUMP THE WALLÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ TO ACCESS BLOCKED PLATFORMS. THESE USERS COME TO TWITTER SEEKING MORE DIVERSE INFORMATION AND AN ONLINE PUBLIC SPHERE BUT INSTEAD THEY FIND AN INFORMATION ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH A SMALL NUMBER OF ANTI-CHINESE-STATE VOICES ARE ATTEMPTING TO USE AUTOMATION TO DOMINATE DISCOURSE.

THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE ROLE OF VISUAL PROPAGANDA IN THE SOCIAL MEDIA AGE BY ANALYZING THEMES, FRAMES, AND STRUCTURAL FEATURES OF IMAGES POSTED ON THE OFFICIAL FACEBOOK PAGES OF SYRIAN PRESIDENT BASHAR AL-ASSAD AND THE NATIONAL COALITION OF SYRIAN REVOLUTION AND OPPOSITION FORCES IN 2013 AND 2014. OUR CONTENT ANALYSIS SHOWS INTERESTING DIFFERENCES AND SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES IN USING IMAGES TO PROMOTE THEIR POLITICAL AGENDAS DURING THE RECENT SYRIAN CONFLICTS FOLLOWING THE 2011 UPRISINGS. THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT USED VISUAL FRAMES TO SUPPORT ITS NARRATIVE THAT PRESIDENT ASSAD IS A FEARLESS LEADER PROTECTING ITS PEOPLE AND THAT LIFE HAS CONTINUED NORMALLY THROUGHOUT SYRIA. THE SYRIAN OPPOSITION USED VARIOUS IMAGES TO SOLIDIFY ITS NARRATIVE OF THE ASSAD REGIME'S BRUTALITY AND SUFFERINGS OF SYRIAN CIVILIANS.

543,BLACK TROLLS MATTER RACIAL AND IDEOLOGICAL ASYMMETRIES IN SOCIAL MEDIA DISINFORMATION,"THE RECENT RISE OF DISINFORMATION AND PROPAGANDA ON SOCIAL MEDIA HAS ATTRACTED STRONG INTEREST FROM SOCIAL SCIENTISTS. RESEARCH ON THE TOPIC HAS REPEATEDLY OBSERVED IDEOLOGICAL ASYMMETRIES IN DISINFORMATION CONTENT AND RECEPTION, WHEREIN CONSERVATIVES ARE MORE LIKELY TO VIEW, REDISTRIBUTE, AND BELIEVE SUCH CONTENT. HOWEVER, PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE HAS SUGGESTED THAT RACE MAY ALSO PLAY A SUBSTANTIAL ROLE IN DETERMINING THE TARGETING AND CONSUMPTION OF DISINFORMATION CONTENT. SUCH RACIAL ASYMMETRIES MAY EXIST ALONGSIDE, OR EVEN INSTEAD OF, IDEOLOGICAL ONES. OUR COMPUTATIONAL ANALYSIS OF 5.2 MILLION TWEETS BY THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT-FUNDED Ã¢â‚¬Å“TROLL FARMÃ¢â‚¬Â KNOWN AS THE INTERNET RESEARCH AGENCY SHEDS LIGHT ON THESE POSSIBILITIES. WE FIND STARK DIFFERENCES IN THE NUMBERS OF UNIQUE ACCOUNTS AND TWEETS ORIGINATING FROM OSTENSIBLY LIBERAL, CONSERVATIVE, AND BLACK LEFT-LEANING INDIVIDUALS.

IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE AN INTEGRATED METHODOLOGY FOR THE DATA COLLECTION, THE RECONSTRUCTION, THE ANALYSIS AND THE VISUALIZATION OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF A COUNTRYÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S POLITICAL LANDSCAPE FROM TWITTER DATA. METHOD THE PROPOSED METHOD RELIES SOLELY ON THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN TWITTER ACCOUNTS AND IS INDEPENDENT OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SHARED CONTENTS SUCH AS THE LANGUAGE OF THE TWEETS. WE VALIDATE OUR METHODOLOGY ON A CASE STUDY ON THE 2017 FRENCH PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION (60 MILLION TWITTER EXCHANGES BETWEEN MORE THAN 2.4 MILLION USERS) VIA TWO INDEPENDENT METHODS: THE COMPARISON BETWEEN OUR AUTOMATED POLITICAL CATEGORIZATION AND A HUMAN CATEGORIZATION BASED ON THE EVALUATION OF A SAMPLE OF 5000 PROFILES DESCRIPTIONS; THE CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THE RECONFIGURATIONS DETECTED IN THE RECONSTRUCTED POLITICAL LANDSCAPE AND KEY POLITICAL EVENTS REPORTED IN THE MEDIA. THIS LATTER VALIDATION DEMONSTRATED THE ABILITY OF OUR APPROACH TO ACCURATELY REFLECT THE RECONFIGURATIONS AT PLAY IN THE OFF-LINE POLITICAL SCENE. RESULTS WE BUILT ON THIS RECONSTRUCTION TO GIVE INSIGHTS INTO THE OPINION DYNAMICS AND THE RECONFIGURATIONS OF POLITICAL COMMUNITIES AT PLAY DURING A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. FIRST, WE PROPOSE A QUANTITATIVE DESCRIPTION AND ANALYSIS OF THE POLITICAL ENGAGEMENT OF MEMBERS OF POLITICAL COMMUNITIES. SECOND, WE ANALYZE THE IMPACT OF POLITICAL COMMUNITIES ON INFORMATION DIFFUSION AND IN PARTICULAR ON THEIR ROLE IN THE FAKE NEWS PHENOMENA. WE MEASURE A DIFFERENTIAL ECHO CHAMBER EFFECT ON THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF POLITICAL NEWS (FAKE NEWS, DEBUNKS, STANDARD NEWS) CAUSED BY THE COMMUNITY STRUCTURE AND EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF ADDRESSING THE MESO-STRUCTURES OF POLITICAL NETWORKS IN UNDERSTANDING THE FAKE NEWS PHENOMENA. CONCLUSIONS GIVING ACCESS TO AN INTERMEDIATE LEVEL, BETWEEN SOCIOLOGICAL SURVEYS IN THE FIELD AND LARGE STATISTICAL STUDIES (SUCH AS THOSE CONDUCTED BY NATIONAL OR INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS) WE DEMONSTRATE THAT SOCIAL NETWORKS DATA MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO QUALIFY AND QUANTIFY THE ACTIVITY OF POLITICAL COMMUNITIES IN A MULTI-POLAR POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT; AS WELL AS THEIR TEMPORAL EVOLUTION AND RECONFIGURATION, THEIR STRUCTURE, THEIR ALLIANCE STRATEGIES AND THEIR SEMANTIC PARTICULARITIES DURING A PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN THROUGH THE ANALYSIS OF THEIR DIGITAL TRACES.

152,HOW COLLEGE STUDENTS EVALUATE AND SHARE FAKE NEWS STORIES,"THE SPREAD OF Ã¢â‚¬Å“FAKE NEWSÃ¢â‚¬Â STORIES ONLINE HAS BECOME A PRESSING CONCERN IN THE UNITED STATES AND AROUND THE WORLD IN RECENT YEARS. SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS ENABLE THE RAPID SPREAD OF SUCH MISINFORMATION AND ALSO MAKE EVALUATING THE CREDIBILITY OF ONLINE INFORMATION MORE DIFFICULT. SINCE COLLEGE STUDENTS ARE FREQUENT USERS OF SOCIAL MEDIA, THEY ARE PARTICULARLY LIKELY TO BE EXPOSED TO FAKE NEWS. A SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED WITH 63 UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS IN WHICH THEY IDENTIFIED AND EVALUATED EXAMPLES OF BOTH FAKE AND REAL NEWS STORIES AND REPORTED THEIR ASSOCIATED INFORMATION BEHAVIORS. RESULTS SHOWED CORRELATIONS BETWEEN ACCURATE IDENTIFICATION OF FAKE NEWS STORIES AND SPECIFIC CRITICAL EVALUATION BEHAVIORS AND STRATEGIES. HOWEVER, STUDENTS WERE UNABLE TO ACCURATELY EVALUATE THEIR OWN SKILLS, AND THEIR WILLINGNESS TO SHARE FAKE NEWS STORIES ON SOCIAL MEDIA WAS NOT RELATED TO ACCURATE IDENTIFICATIONS OR EVALUATIONS OF TRUSTWORTHINESS.

450,COVID19 AND THE FILM YOUR HOSPITAL CONSPIRACY THEORY SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS OF TWITTER DATA,"BACKGROUND: DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, A NUMBER OF CONSPIRACY THEORIES HAVE EMERGED. A POPULAR THEORY POSITS THAT THE PANDEMIC IS A HOAX AND SUGGESTS THAT CERTAIN HOSPITALS ARE Ã¢â‚¬Å“EMPTY.Ã¢â‚¬Â RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT ACCEPTING CONSPIRACY THEORIES INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD THAT AN INDIVIDUAL MAY IGNORE GOVERNMENT ADVICE ABOUT SOCIAL DISTANCING AND OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTIONS. DUE TO THE POSSIBILITY OF A SECOND WAVE AND FUTURE PANDEMICS, IT IS IMPORTANT TO GAIN AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE DRIVERS OF MISINFORMATION AND STRATEGIES TO MITIGATE IT. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY SET OUT TO EVALUATE THE #FILMYOURHOSPITAL CONSPIRACY THEORY ON TWITTER, ATTEMPTING TO UNDERSTAND THE DRIVERS BEHIND IT. MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE OBJECTIVES WERE TO DETERMINE WHICH ONLINE SOURCES OF INFORMATION WERE USED AS EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE THEORY, THE RATIO OF AUTOMATED TO ORGANIC ACCOUNTS IN THE NETWORK, AND WHAT LESSONS CAN BE LEARNED TO MITIGATE THE SPREAD OF SUCH A CONSPIRACY THEORY IN THE FUTURE. METHODS: TWITTER DATA RELATED TO THE #FILMYOURHOSPITAL HASHTAG WERE RETRIEVED AND ANALYZED USING SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS ACROSS A 7-DAY PERIOD FROM APRIL 13-20, 2020. THE DATA SET CONSISTED OF 22,785 TWEETS AND 11,333 TWITTER USERS. THE BOTOMETER TOOL WAS USED TO IDENTIFY ACCOUNTS WITH A HIGHER PROBABILITY OF BEING BOTS. RESULTS: THE MOST IMPORTANT DRIVERS OF THE CONSPIRACY THEORY ARE ORDINARY CITIZENS; ONE OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL ACCOUNTS IS A BREXIT SUPPORTER. WE FOUND THAT YOUTUBE WAS THE INFORMATION SOURCE MOST LINKED TO BY USERS. THE MOST RETWEETED POST BELONGED TO A VERIFIED TWITTER USER, INDICATING THAT THE USER MAY HAVE HAD MORE INFLUENCE ON THE PLATFORM. THERE WAS A SMALL NUMBER OF AUTOMATED ACCOUNTS (BOTS) AND DELETED ACCOUNTS WITHIN THE NETWORK. CONCLUSIONS: HASHTAGS USING AND SHARING CONSPIRACY THEORIES CAN BE TARGETED IN AN EFFORT TO DELEGITIMIZE CONTENT CONTAINING MISINFORMATION. SOCIAL MEDIA ORGANIZATIONS NEED TO BOLSTER THEIR EFFORTS TO LABEL OR REMOVE CONTENT THAT CONTAINS MISINFORMATION. PUBLIC HEALTH AUTHORITIES COULD ENLIST THE ASSISTANCE OF INFLUENCERS IN SPREADING ANTINARRATIVE CONTENT.

589,DONALD TRUMP IS MY PRESIDENT THE INTERNET RESEARCH AGENCY PROPAGANDA MACHINE,"THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS A TYPOLOGICAL STUDY OF THE TWITTER ACCOUNTS OPERATED BY THE INTERNET RESEARCH AGENCY (IRA), A COMPANY SPECIALIZED IN ONLINE INFLUENCE OPERATIONS BASED IN ST. PETERSBURG, RUSSIA. DRAWING ON CONCEPTS FROM 20TH-CENTURY PROPAGANDA THEORY, WE MODELED THE IRA OPERATIONS ALONG PROPAGANDA CLASSES AND CAMPAIGN TARGETS. THE STUDY RELIES ON TWO HISTORICAL DATABASES AND DATA FROM THE INTERNET ARCHIVE'S WAYBACK MACHINE TO RETRIEVE 826 USER PROFILES AND 6,377 TWEETS POSTED BY THE AGENCY BETWEEN 2012 AND 2017. WE MANUALLY CODED THE SOURCE AS IDENTIFIABLE, OBFUSCATED, OR IMPERSONATED AND CLASSIFIED THE CAMPAIGN TARGET OF IRA OPERATIONS USING AN INDUCTIVE TYPOLOGY BASED ON PROFILE DESCRIPTIONS, IMAGES, LOCATION, LANGUAGE, AND TWEETED CONTENT. THE QUALITATIVE VARIABLES WERE ANALYZED AS RELATIVE FREQUENCIES TO TEST THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE IRA'S BLACK, GRAY, AND WHITE PROPAGANDA ARE DEPLOYED WITH CLEARLY DEFINED TARGETS FOR SHORT-, MEDIUM-, AND LONG-TERM PROPAGANDA STRATEGIES. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT SOURCE CLASSIFICATION FROM PROPAGANDA THEORY REMAINS A VALID FRAMEWORK TO UNDERSTAND IRA'S PROPAGANDA MACHINE AND THAT THE AGENCY OPERATES A COMPOSITE OF DIFFERENT USER ACCOUNTS TAILORED TO PERFORM SPECIFIC TASKS, INCLUDING OPENLY PRO-RUSSIAN PROFILES, LOCAL AMERICAN AND GERMAN NEWS SOURCES, PRO-TRUMP CONSERVATIVES, AND BLACK LIVES MATTER ACTIVISTS.",PROPAGANDA; INTERNET RESEARCH AGENCY; TROLLS; DISINFORMATION; TWITTER,SOCIAL MEDIA,2019,https://doi.org/10.1177/2056305119865466,"6,7,8",NA,0,0,0,UNITED KINGDOM,SOCIAL MEDIA + SOCIETY
40,KIDNAPPING WHATSAPP RUMORS DURING THE SEARCH AND RESCUE OPERATION OF THREE KIDNAPPED YOUTH,"DURING TERROR ATTACKS, INFORMATION WITH UNKNOWN CREDIBILITY MIGHT CIRCULATE AND PEOPLE USE RUMORS TO COMPENSATE FOR INFORMATION GAPS. ON 06.12.2014, THREE TEENAGERS WERE KIDNAPPED FROM A BUS STATION IN THE WEST BANK AND FOUND DEAD AFTER SEVERAL DAYS. A GAG ORDER WAS ISSUED, CAUSING INTEREST IN ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF INFORMATION. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED HOW INFORMATION SPREAD THROUGH WHATSAPP DURING THE SEARCH OPERATION USING A PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH APPROACH. 13 RUMORS CIRCULATING ON WHATSAPP WERE COLLECTED, NINE OF WHICH WERE VERIFIED, AND FOUND TO BE TRUE. A WEB-BASED SURVEY REVEALED THAT 61.1% OF 419 RESPONDENTS RECEIVED INFORMATION REGARDING THE KIDNAPPING THROUGH WHATSAPP; 38.9% THROUGH FACEBOOK. SOURCES OF TWO RUMORS AND PARTICIPATION OF EMERGENCY AUTHORITIES IN RUMOR DISSEMINATION WERE IDENTIFIED. SOME RUMORS ORIGINATED FROM THE FAMILY AND COMMUNITY OF THE ABDUCTEES, WHILE OTHER WHATSAPP MESSAGES INCLUDED INFORMATION AND NAMES OF TWO ABDUCTEES, WHICH WERE NOT PUBLIC AT THE TIME. WHEN EMERGENCY AUTHORITIES SHARE UNCONFIRMED INFORMATION, IT IS PERCEIVED AS MORE CREDIBLE THAN INFORMATION SPREAD BY CITIZENS. DURING THE OPERATION, OFFICIAL REPRESENTATIVES DID NOT CORRECT OR REFUTE ANY RUMORS. LOCATING THE SOURCE OF A RUMOR IS CHALLENGING AND THUS IT IS IMPORTANT TO ACTIVELY INVESTIGATE RUMORS IN REAL-TIME IN ORDER TO LOCATE THE SOURCE.

THIS STUDY SEEKS TO EX-AMINE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL ANTECEDENTS OF INFORMATION RE-SHARING BEHAVIOR INCLUDING INDIVIDUAL BELIEFS ABOUT THE QUALITY OF INFORMATION AVAILABLE ON SOCIAL NETWORK SITES (SNSS), ATTITUDE TOWARDS SNS USE AND RISK PERCEPTIONS AND ATTITUDES. METHODOLOGY TESTING THE RESEARCH MODEL BY DATA COLLECTED THROUGH SURVEYS THAT WERE ADMINIS-TERED TO TEST THE RESEARCH MODEL. DATA WAS COLLECTED FROM UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS IN A PUBLIC UNIVERSITY IN THE US. CONTRIBUTION THIS STUDY CONTRIBUTES TO THEORY IN INFORMATION SYSTEMS BY ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF INFORMATION QUALITY IN THE CONTEXT OF INFORMATION RE-SHARING ON SOCIAL MEDIA. THIS STUDY HAS IMPORTANT PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS FOR SNS USERS AND PROVIDERS ALIKE. ENSURING THAT INFORMATION AVAILABLE ON SNS IS OF HIGH QUALITY IS CRITICAL TO MAIN-TAINING A HEALTHY USER BASE. FINDINGS RESULTS INDICATE THAT ATTITUDE TOWARD USING SNSS AND INTENTION TO RE-SHARE INFOR-MATION ON SNSS IS INFLUENCED BY PERCEIVED INFORMATION QUALITY (ENJOYMENT, RELE-VANCE, AND RELIABILITY). ALSO, RISK-TAKING PROPENSITY AND ENJOYMENT INFLUENCE THE INTENTION TO RE-SHARE INFORMATION ON SNSS IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION.

61,A NOVEL APPROACH TO IDENTIFYING BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS IN RAISING A CHILD WITH TYPE 1 DIABETES QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF CAREGIVER BLOGS,"BACKGROUND: WITH RISING INCIDENCE OF TYPE 1 DIABETES (T1D) DIAGNOSES AMONG CHILDREN AND THE HIGH LEVELS OF DISTRESS EXPERIENCED BY THE CAREGIVERS OF THESE CHILDREN, CAREGIVER SUPPORT IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT. HISTORICALLY, RELATIVELY FEW SUPPORT RESOURCES HAVE EXISTED. INCREASING USE OF THE INTERNET, AND BLOGS IN PARTICULAR, HAS SEEN A GROWTH OF PEER SUPPORT BETWEEN CAREGIVERS OF CHILDREN WITH T1D. HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE TYPE AND QUALITY OF INFORMATION SHARED ON T1D CAREGIVER BLOGS. AT THE SAME TIME, THE INFORMATION ON SUCH BLOGS OFFERS A NEW WINDOW INTO WHAT CHALLENGES AND SUCCESSES CAREGIVERS EXPERIENCE IN HELPING TO MANAGE THEIR CHILDREN'S T1D. OBJECTIVE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO (1) ANALYZE BLOGS OF CAREGIVERS TO CHILDREN WITH T1D TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE CHALLENGES AND SUCCESSES THEY FACE IN RAISING A CHILD WITH T1D, AND (2) ASSESS THE BLOGS FOR THE PRESENCE OF UNSAFE OR INACCURATE CLINICAL INFORMATION OR ADVICE. METHODS: AN INDUCTIVE THEMATIC QUALITATIVE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED OF THREE BLOGS AUTHORED BY CAREGIVERS OF CHILDREN LIVING WITH T1D, WHICH INCLUDED 140 UNIQUE BLOG POSTS AND 663 ASSOCIATED COMMENTS. TWO PHYSICIAN INVESTIGATORS EVALUATED THE BLOGS FOR PRESENCE OF CLINICAL OR MEDICAL MISINFORMATION. RESULTS: FIVE MAJOR THEMES EMERGED: (1) THE IMPACT OF THE CHILD'S DIAGNOSIS, (2) THE BURDEN OF INTENSE SELF-MANAGEMENT EXPERIENCED IN CARING FOR A CHILD WITH T1D, (3) CAREGIVERS' USE OF TECHNOLOGY TO EASE THEIR FEAR OF HYPOGLYCEMIA AND IMPACTS THAT DEVICE ALARMS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS TECHNOLOGY HAVE ON CAREGIVER BURDEN, (4) CAREGIVERS' PERCEPTIONS OF FREQUENTLY MISSED OR DELAYED DIAGNOSIS OF T1D AND THE FRUSTRATION THIS CAUSES, AND (5) THE RESILIENCE THAT CAREGIVERS DEVELOP DESPITE THE BURDENS THEY EXPERIENCE. MISINFORMATION WAS EXCEEDINGLY RARE AND BENIGN WHEN IT DID OCCUR. CONCLUSIONS: BLOG ANALYSIS REPRESENTS A NOVEL APPROACH TO UNDERSTAND THE T1D CAREGIVER'S EXPERIENCE. THIS QUALITATIVE STUDY FOUND MANY CHALLENGES THAT CAREGIVERS FACE IN RAISING A CHILD WITH T1D. DESPITE THE MANY BARRIERS CAREGIVERS FACE IN MANAGING THEIR CHILDREN'S T1D, THEY FIND SUPPORT THROUGH ADVOCACY EFFORTS AND PEER-TO-PEER BLOGGING. BLOGS PROVIDE A UNIQUE AVENUE FOR SUPPORT, WITH ONLY RARE AND BENIGN FINDINGS OF MEDICAL MISINFORMATION, AND MAY BE A RESOURCE THAT DIABETES CARE PROVIDERS CAN CONSIDER OFFERING TO FAMILIES FOR SUPPORT.

THEY CIRCULATED ON WHATSAPP PLATFORM, AS CASE STUDIES. WE CATEGORIZED CLAIMS AS OBJECTIVELY TRUE, FALSE, OR POTENTIALLY MISLEADING. THE CONTENT ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT Ã¢â‚¬Å“POTENTIALLY MISLEADINGÃ¢â‚¬Â CLAIMS WERE THE MOST FREQUENT MESSAGES (59.1%). THEY TEND TO EXAGGERATE THE EFFICACY OR SAFETY WITHOUT SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO SUBSTANTIATE CLAIMS. FALSE CLAIMS (27.3%) WERE LIKELY DUE TO UNFAIR COMPETITION OR DECEPTION. OVERALL, 13.6% OF THE MESSAGES WERE OBJECTIVELY TRUE CLAIMS THAT COULD WITHSTAND REGULATORY SCRUTINY. MAJORITY OF THE DRUG-RELATED MESSAGES ON SOCIAL MEDIA WERE POTENTIALLY MISLEADING OR FALSE CLAIMS THAT LACKED CREDIBLE EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THEM.

GUIDED BY THE MODEL OF STIGMA COMMUNICATION, WE EXAMINE FOUR TYPES OF MESSAGE CONTENT, NAMELY MARK, GROUP LABELING, RESPONSIBILITY, AND PERIL, THAT ARE INSTRUMENTAL IN FORMING STIGMA BELIEFS AND SHARING STIGMA MESSAGES. WE ALSO EXPLORE WHETHER THE PRESENCE OF MISINFORMATION AND CONSPIRACY THEORIES IN COVID-19-RELATED TWEETS IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRESENCE OF COVID-19 STIGMA CONTENT. A TOTAL OF 155,353 UNIQUE COVID-19-RELATED TWEETS POSTED BETWEEN DECEMBER 31, 2019, AND MARCH 13, 2020, WERE IDENTIFIED, FROM WHICH 7000 TWEETS WERE RANDOMLY SELECTED FOR MANUAL CODING. RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE PERIL OF COVID-19 WAS MENTIONED THE MOST OFTEN, FOLLOWED BY MARK, RESPONSIBILITY, AND GROUP LABELING CONTENT. TWEETS WITH CONSPIRACY THEORIES WERE MORE LIKELY TO INCLUDE GROUP LABELING AND RESPONSIBILITY INFORMATION, BUT LESS LIKELY TO MENTION COVID-19 PERIL.

465,WHAT TO BELIEVE SOCIAL MEDIA COMMENTARY AND BELIEF IN MISINFORMATION,"AMERICANS ARE INCREASINGLY TURNING TO SOCIAL MEDIA FOR POLITICAL INFORMATION. HOWEVER, GIVEN THAT THE AVERAGE SOCIAL MEDIA USER ONLY CLICKS THROUGH ON A SMALL FRACTION OF THE POLITICAL CONTENT AVAILABLE, THE BRIEF ARTICLE PREVIEWS THAT APPEAR IN THE NEWS FEED LIKELY SERVE AS SHORTCUTS TO POLITICAL INFORMATION. YET, IN ADDITION TO SHARING POLITICAL NEWS, SOCIAL MEDIA ALSO ALLOW USERS TO MAKE THEIR OWN COMMENTS ON NEWS POSTS, COMMENTS WHICH MAY CHALLENGE OR DISTORT THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE ARTICLES. IN THIS PAPER, WE FIRST ANALYZE HOW SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS ON TWITTER AND FACEBOOK DIFFER FROM THE ACTUAL CONTENT OF THEIR LINKED NEWS ARTICLES, FINDING THAT SOCIAL MEDIA COMMENTS REGULARLY MISREPRESENT THE FACTS REPORTED IN THE NEWS. WE THEN USE A SURVEY EXPERIMENT TO TEST THE CONSEQUENCES OF THESE INFORMATION DISCREPANCIES. SPECIFICALLY, WE RANDOMLY ASSIGN INDIVIDUALS TO READ A FULL NEWS ARTICLE, A NEWS ARTICLE PREVIEW POST (AS SEEN ON FACEBOOK), OR A NEWS ARTICLE PREVIEW WITH MISINFORMATIVE SOCIAL COMMENTARY ATTACHED.

THESE TECHNOLOGIES ARE WIDELY USED, AND INACCURATE INFORMATION FLOWING ACROSS THEM HAS A HIGH PROFILE. THIS RESEARCH USES THREE-WAVE PANEL SURVEYS CONDUCTED WITH REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLES OF AMERICANS DURING BOTH THE 2012 AND 2016 U.S. PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS TO ASSESS WHETHER USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA FOR POLITICAL INFORMATION PROMOTED ENDORSEMENT OF FALSEHOODS ABOUT MAJOR PARTY CANDIDATES OR IMPORTANT CAMPAIGN ISSUES. FIXED EFFECTS REGRESSION HELPS ENSURE THAT OBSERVED EFFECTS ARE NOT DUE TO INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES. RESULTS INDICATE THAT SOCIAL MEDIA USE HAD A SMALL BUT SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE ON MISPERCEPTIONS ABOUT PRESIDENT OBAMA IN THE 2012 ELECTION, AND THAT THIS EFFECT WAS MOST PRONOUNCED AMONG STRONG PARTISANS. SOCIAL MEDIA HAD NO EFFECT ON BELIEF ACCURACY ABOUT THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE IN THAT ELECTION. THE 2016 SURVEY FOCUSED ON CAMPAIGN ISSUES. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT SOCIAL MEDIA USE INFLUENCED BELIEF ACCURACY ABOUT THESE TOPICS IN AGGREGATE, BUT FACEBOOK USERS WERE UNIQUE. SOCIAL MEDIA USE BY THIS GROUP REDUCED ISSUE MISPERCEPTIONS RELATIVE TO THOSE WHO ONLY USED OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA. THESE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT SOCIAL MEDIA CAN ALTER CITIZENS' WILLINGNESS TO ENDORSE FALSEHOODS DURING AN ELECTION, BUT THAT THE EFFECTS ARE OFTEN SMALL.",NA,NEWS; MISINFORMATION; IDEOLOGY; EXPOSURE,2019,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0213500,1,NA,0,0,0,USA,PLOS ONE

OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ESTIMATE THE PROPORTION OF VACCINE-RELATED TWITTER POSTS LINKED TO WEB PAGES OF LOW CREDIBILITY AND MEASURE THE POTENTIAL REACH OF THOSE POSTS. METHODS: SAMPLING FROM 143,003 UNIQUE VACCINE-RELATED WEB PAGES SHARED ON TWITTER BETWEEN JANUARY 2017 AND MARCH 2018, WE USED A 7-POINT CHECKLIST ADAPTED FROM VALIDATED TOOLS AND GUIDELINES TO MANUALLY APPRAISE THE CREDIBILITY OF 474 WEB PAGES. THESE WERE USED TO TRAIN SEVERAL CLASSIFIERS (RANDOM FORESTS, SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES, AND RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS) USING THE TEXT FROM A WEB PAGE TO PREDICT WHETHER THE INFORMATION SATISFIES EACH OF THE 7 CRITERIA. ESTIMATING THE CREDIBILITY OF ALL OTHER WEB PAGES, WE USED THE FOLLOWER NETWORK TO ESTIMATE POTENTIAL EXPOSURES RELATIVE TO A CREDIBILITY SCORE DEFINED BY THE 7-POINT CHECKLIST. RESULTS: THE BEST-PERFORMING CLASSIFIERS WERE ABLE TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN LOW, MEDIUM, AND HIGH CREDIBILITY WITH AN ACCURACY OF 78% AND LABELED LOW-CREDIBILITY WEB PAGES WITH A PRECISION OF OVER 96%. ACROSS THE SET OF UNIQUE WEB PAGES, 11.86% (16,961 OF 143,003) WERE ESTIMATED AS LOW CREDIBILITY AND THEY GENERATED 9.34% (1.64 BILLION OF 17.6 BILLION) OF POTENTIAL EXPOSURES. THE 100 MOST POPULAR LINKS TO LOW CREDIBILITY WEB PAGES WERE EACH POTENTIALLY SEEN BY AN ESTIMATED 2 MILLION TO 80 MILLION TWITTER USERS GLOBALLY. CONCLUSIONS: THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT ALTHOUGH A SMALL MINORITY OF LOW-CREDIBILITY WEB PAGES REACH A LARGE AUDIENCE, LOW-CREDIBILITY WEB PAGES TEND TO REACH FEWER USERS THAN OTHER WEB PAGES OVERALL AND ARE MORE COMMONLY SHARED WITHIN CERTAIN SUBPOPULATIONS. AN AUTOMATIC CREDIBILITY APPRAISAL TOOL MAY BE USEFUL FOR FINDING COMMUNITIES OF USERS AT HIGHER RISK OF EXPOSURE TO LOW-CREDIBILITY VACCINE COMMUNICATIONS.

590,FALSE NEWS OF A CANNABIS CANCER CURE,"BACKGROUND THERE IS INCREASING CONCERN AMONG HEALTHCARE COMMUNITIES ABOUT THE MISINFORMATION ONLINE ABOUT USING CANNABIS TO CURE CANCER. WE HAVE CHARACTERIZED THIS ONLINE INTEREST IN USING CANNABIS AS A CANCER TREATMENT AND THE PROPAGATION OF THIS INFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA. MATERIALS & METHODS WE COMPARED SEARCH ACTIVITY OVER TIME FOR CANNABIS AND CANCER VERSUS STANDARD CANCER THERAPIES USING GOOGLE TRENDS' RELATIVE SEARCH VOLUME (RSV) TOOL AND DETERMINED THE IMPACT OF CANNABIS LEGALIZATION. WE CLASSIFIED NEWS ON SOCIAL MEDIA ABOUT CANNABIS USE IN CANCER AS FALSE, ACCURATE, OR IRRELEVANT. WE EVALUATED THE CANNABIS-RELATED SOCIAL MEDIA ACTIVITIES OF CANCER ORGANIZATIONS. RESULTS THE ONLINE SEARCH VOLUME FOR CANNABIS AND CANCER INCREASED AT 10 TIMES THE RATE OF STANDARD THERAPIES (RSV 0.10/MONTH VERSUS 0.01/MONTH, P<0.001), MORE SO IN STATES WHERE MEDICAL OR RECREATIONAL CANNABIS IS LEGAL. THE USE OF CANNABIS AS A CANCER CURE REPRESENTED THE LARGEST CATEGORY (23.5%) OF SOCIAL MEDIA CONTENT ON ALTERNATIVE CANCER TREATMENTS.

55,ON THE STATISTICAL PROPERTIES OF VIRAL MISINFORMATION IN ONLINE SOCIAL MEDIA,"THE MASSIVE DIFFUSION OF ONLINE SOCIAL MEDIA ALLOWS FOR THE RAPID AND UNCONTROLLED SPREADING OF CONSPIRACY THEORIES, HOAXES, UNSUBSTANTIATED CLAIMS, AND FALSE NEWS. SUCH AN IMPRESSIVE AMOUNT OF MISINFORMATION CAN INFLUENCE POLICY PREFERENCES AND ENCOURAGE BEHAVIORS STRONGLY DIVERGENT FROM RECOMMENDED PRACTICES. IN THIS PAPER, WE STUDY THE STATISTICAL PROPERTIES OF VIRAL MISINFORMATION IN ONLINE SOCIAL MEDIA. BY MEANS OF METHODS BELONGING TO EXTREME VALUE THEORY, WE SHOW THAT THE NUMBER OF EXTREMELY VIRAL POSTS OVER TIME FOLLOWS A HOMOGENEOUS POISSON PROCESS, AND THAT THE INTERARRIVAL TIMES BETWEEN SUCH POSTS ARE INDEPENDENT AND IDENTICALLY DISTRIBUTED, FOLLOWING AN EXPONENTIAL DISTRIBUTION. MOREOVER, WE CHARACTERIZE THE UNCERTAINTY AROUND THE RATE PARAMETER OF THE POISSON PROCESS THROUGH BAYESIAN METHODS. FINALLY, WE ARE ABLE TO DERIVE THE PREDICTIVE POSTERIOR PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION OF THE NUMBER OF POSTS EXCEEDING A CERTAIN THRESHOLD OF SHARES OVER A FINITE INTERVAL OF TIME.

306,USER MOTIVATION IN FAKE NEWS SHARING DURING THE COVID19 PANDEMIC AN APPLICATION OF THE USES AND GRATIFICATION THEORY,"PURPOSE: THIS STUDY DEVELOPED A PREDICTIVE MODEL THAT ESTABLISHED THE USER MOTIVATIONAL FACTORS THAT PREDICT COVID-19 FAKE NEWS SHARING ON SOCIAL MEDIA. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: THE PARTIAL LEAST SQUARES STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELLING (PLS-SEM) WAS USED FOR THE ANALYSIS. DATA WERE DRAWN FROM 152 FACEBOOK AND WHATSAPP USERS IN NIGERIA TO EXAMINE THE RESEARCH MODEL FORMULATED USING THE USES AND GRATIFICATION THEORY (UGT). FINDINGS: WE FOUND THAT ALTRUISM, INSTANT NEWS SHARING, SOCIALISATION AND SELF-PROMOTION PREDICTED FAKE NEWS SHARING RELATED TO COVID-19 PANDEMIC AMONG SOCIAL MEDIA USERS IN NIGERIA. SPECIFICALLY, ALTRUISM WAS THE STRONGEST PREDICTOR TO FAKE NEWS SHARING BEHAVIOUR RELATED TO COVID-19, FOLLOWED BY INSTANT NEWS SHARING AND SOCIALISATION. ON THE CONTRARY, ENTERTAINMENT HAD NO ASSOCIATION WITH FAKE NEWS SHARING ON COVID-19. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: WE SUGGEST INTERVENTION STRATEGIES WHICH NUDGE PEOPLE TO BE SCEPTICAL OF THE INFORMATION THEY COME ACROSS ON SOCIAL MEDIA. WE ALSO RECOMMEND HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND THE NIGERIAN GOVERNMENT TO PROVIDE RELEVANT INFORMATION ON THIS CURRENT PANDEMIC. THAT IS, CORRECT INFORMATION SHOULD BE SHARED WIDELY TO THE PUBLIC DOMAIN THROUGH VARIOUS CONVENTIONAL AND ONLINE MEDIA. THIS WILL LESSEN THE SPREAD OF FAKE NEWS ON THE CONCOCTED CURE AND PREVENTION TIPS FOUND ONLINE. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: THE SALIENT CONTRIBUTIONS OF THIS STUDY ARE AS FOLLOWS: FIRST, IT BRINGS TO THE FORE THAT THE DESIRE FOR SELF-PROMOTION IS ASSOCIATED WITH FAKE NEWS SHARING ON SOCIAL MEDIA; SECOND, IT SHIFTS THE FOCUS OF STUDIES ON FAKE NEWS FROM DETECTION METHODS TO SHARING BEHAVIOUR, WHICH FUELS THE UNCONTROLLABLE SPREAD OF FALSEHOOD; THIRD, IT EXPANDS THE EXISTING LITERATURE ON MISINFORMATION SHARING BY DEMONSTRATING THE USER MOTIVATION THAT LEADS TO FAKE NEWS SHARING USING THE UGT.

433,DIMENSIONS OF MISINFORMATION ABOUT THE HPV VACCINE ON INSTAGRAM CONTENT AND NETWORK ANALYSIS OF SOCIAL MEDIA CHARACTERISTICS,"BACKGROUND: THE HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS (HPV) VACCINE IS A MAJOR ADVANCEMENT IN CANCER PREVENTION AND THIS PRIMARY PREVENTION TOOL HAS THE POTENTIAL TO REDUCE AND ELIMINATE HPV-ASSOCIATED CANCERS; HOWEVER, THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF VACCINES IN GENERAL AND THE HPV VACCINE SPECIFICALLY HAVE COME UNDER ATTACK, PARTICULARLY THROUGH THE SPREAD OF MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA. THE POPULAR SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM INSTAGRAM REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF EXPOSURE TO HEALTH (MIS)INFORMATION; 1 IN 3 US ADULTS USE INSTAGRAM. OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS ANALYSIS WAS TO CHARACTERIZE PRO- AND ANTI-HPV VACCINE NETWORKS ON INSTAGRAM, AND TO DESCRIBE MISINFORMATION WITHIN THE ANTI-HPV VACCINE NETWORK. METHODS: FROM APRIL 2018 TO DECEMBER 2018, WE COLLECTED PUBLICLY AVAILABLE ENGLISH-LANGUAGE INSTAGRAM POSTS CONTAINING HASHTAGS #HPV, #HPVVACCINE, OR #GARDASIL USING NETLYTIC SOFTWARE (N=16,607). WE RANDOMLY SELECTED 10% OF THE SAMPLE AND CONTENT ANALYZED RELEVANT POSTS (N=580) FOR TEXT, IMAGE, AND SOCIAL MEDIA FEATURES AS WELL AS HOLISTIC ATTRIBUTES (EG, SENTIMENTS, PERSONAL STORIES). AMONG ANTIVACCINE POSTS, WE ORGANIZED ELEMENTS OF MISINFORMATION WITHIN FOUR BROAD DIMENSIONS: 1) MISINFORMATION THEORETICAL DOMAINS, 2) VACCINE DEBATE TOPICS, 3) EVIDENCE BASE, AND 4) HEALTH BELIEFS. WE CONDUCTED UNIVARIATE, BIVARIATE, AND NETWORK ANALYSES ON THE SUBSAMPLE OF POSTS TO QUANTIFY THE ROLE AND POSITION OF INDIVIDUAL POSTS IN THE NETWORK. RESULTS: COMPARED TO PROVACCINE POSTS (324/580, 55.9%), ANTIVACCINE POSTS (256/580, 44.1%) WERE MORE LIKELY TO ORIGINATE FROM INDIVIDUALS (64.1% ANTIVACCINE VS 25.0% PROVACCINE; P<.001) AND INCLUDE PERSONAL NARRATIVES (37.1% VS 25.6%; P=.003). IN THE ANTIVACCINE NETWORK, CORE MISINFORMATION CHARACTERISTICS INCLUDED MENTIONING #GARDASIL, PURPORTING TO REVEAL A LIE (IE, CONCEALMENT), CONSPIRACY THEORIES, UNSUBSTANTIATED CLAIMS, AND RISK OF VACCINE INJURY. INFORMATION/RESOURCE POSTS CLUSTERED AROUND MISINFORMATION DOMAINS INCLUDING FALSIFICATION, NANOPUBLICATIONS, AND VACCINE-PREVENTABLE DISEASE, WHEREAS PERSONAL NARRATIVE POSTS CLUSTERED AROUND DIFFERENT DOMAINS OF MISINFORMATION, INCLUDING CONCEALMENT, INJURY, AND CONSPIRACY THEORIES. THE MOST LIKED POST (6634 LIKES) IN OUR FULL SUBSAMPLE WAS A POSITIVE PERSONAL NARRATIVE POST, CREATED BY A NON-HEALTH INDIVIDUAL; THE MOST LIKED POST (5604 LIKES) IN OUR ANTIVACCINE SUBSAMPLE WAS AN INFORMATIONAL POST CREATED BY A HEALTH INDIVIDUAL. CONCLUSIONS: IDENTIFYING CHARACTERISTICS OF MISINFORMATION RELATED TO HPV VACCINE ON SOCIAL MEDIA WILL INFORM TARGETED INTERVENTIONS (EG, NETWORK OPINION LEADERS) AND HELP SOW CORRECTIVE INFORMATION AND STORIES TAILORED TO DIFFERENT FALSEHOODS.

478,THE INFODEMICS OF COVID19 AMONGST HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS IN INDIA,"BACKGROUND: THERE IS A DELUGE OF INFORMATION AND MISINFORMATION ABOUT COVID-19. THE PRESENT SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED TO EXPLORE THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION /MISINFORMATION FOR HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS FROM INDIA. METHODS: A CROSS-SECTIONAL ONLINE SURVEY USING SNOWBALLING TECHNIQUE WAS CONDUCTED FROM 24 MAR TO 10 APR 2020. THE QUESTIONNAIRE WAS PRETESTED AND DEVELOPED USING STANDARD TECHNIQUES. IT WAS CIRCULATED AMONG MEDICAL STUDENTS AND PHYSICIANS. DATA WERE ANALYSED USING THE STATA SOFTWARE. RESULTS: DATA OF 758 PARTICIPANTS WERE ANALYSED. A TOTAL OF 255 (33.6%) MEDICAL STUDENTS, 335 (44.2%) NONSPECIALISTS AND 168 (22.1%) SPECIALISTS PARTICIPATED. THE MOST COMMON SOURCE OF FORMAL AND INFORMAL INFORMATION WAS OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT WEBSITES AND ONLINE NEWS, RESPECTIVELY. A TOTAL OF 517 (68.2%) PARTICIPANTS ACCEPTED RECEIVING MISINFORMATION. SOCIAL MEDIA AND FAMILY AND FRIENDS WERE THE MOST COMMON SOURCES OF MISINFORMATION. SEVENTY-TWO PERCENT OF PARTICIPANTS AGREED THAT SPREAD OF INFORMATION HELPED TO CONTAIN COVID-19, BUT MORE THAN THAT 75% AGREED TO HAVING RECEIVED INACCURATE INFORMATION. SEVENTY-FOUR PERCENT OF RESPONDENTS FELT THE NEED FOR REGULATION OF INFORMATION DURING SUCH TIMES; 26% AND 33% FELT THAT INFORMATION ABOUT COVID-19 MADE THEM FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE AND DISTRACTS ROUTINE DECISION-MAKING, RESPECTIVELY, AND 50% FELT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO DIFFERENTIATE CORRECT FROM INCORRECT INFORMATION ABOUT COVID-19. CONCLUSION: THE STUDY EXPLORED THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION AND MISINFORMATION AND FOUND A HIGH PREVALENCE OF MISINFORMATION, ESPECIALLY FROM SOCIAL MEDIA. WE SUGGEST THE NEED TO BETTER MANAGE THE FLOW OF INFORMATION SO THAT IT CAN BE AN EFFECTIVE WEAPON AGAINST SARS-COV2. THERE IS A NEED FOR DOCTORS TO ADAPT TO THE CHANGING TIMES OF INFODEMICS ACCOMPANYING PANDEMICS.

495,REFUTING FAKE NEWS ON SOCIAL MEDIA NONPROFITS CRISIS RESPONSE STRATEGIES AND ISSUE INVOLVEMENT,"PURPOSE: THE DISSEMINATION OF FAKE NEWS HAS ACCELERATED WITH SOCIAL MEDIA AND THIS HAS IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR BOTH ORGANIZATIONS AND THEIR STAKEHOLDERS ALIKE. HENCE, THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO SHED LIGHT ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE CRISIS RESPONSE STRATEGIES OF DENIAL AND ATTACK IN ADDRESSING RUMORS ABOUT CONSUMER PRIVACY WHEN NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS ARE TARGETED ON SOCIAL MEDIA. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: TO TEST THE HYPOTHESES, A 2 (RESPONSE TYPE: DENIAL VS ATTACK) Ãƒâ€” 2 (PRIVACY CONCERNS: LOW VS HIGH), BETWEEN-GROUP ONLINE EXPERIMENT WAS CONDUCTED VIA QUALTRICS. FINDINGS: THE RESULTS INDICATED THAT ONEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S INVOLVEMENT LEVEL IN THE ISSUE DETERMINES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE CRISIS RESPONSE STRATEGY. DATA SHOWED THAT ATTACKING THE SOURCE OF FAKE NEWS (AS A CRISIS RESPONSE) REDUCES THE MESSAGEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S CREDIBILITY MORE THAN DENYING FAKE NEWS. FURTHERMORE, HIGHLY INVOLVED INDIVIDUALS ARE MORE LIKELY TO CENTRALLY PROCESS INFORMATION AND DEVELOP POSITIVE SUPPORTIVE INTENTIONS TOWARD THE AFFECTED NON-PROFIT BRAND. HIGH ISSUE INVOLVEMENT ALSO PREDICTED ORGANIZATIONAL AND RESPONSE CREDIBILITY. CONVERSELY, AN ATTACK REBUTTAL MESSAGE INCREASED THE CREDIBILITY OF THE CIRCULATED MALICIOUS RUMORS FOR LOW INVOLVED INDIVIDUALS. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT ISSUE INVOLVEMENT PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN MESSAGE PERCEPTIONS OF FALSE INFORMATION REGARDING CONSUMER PRIVACY IN SOCIAL MEDIA. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: PRACTICALLY, THIS STUDY OFFERS INSIGHTS FOR ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE DEVELOPING RESPONSE STRATEGIES IN THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT OF FAKE NEWS. FINDINGS FROM THIS STUDY SUGGEST THAT ORGANIZATIONS NEED TO CONSIDER THE DEGREE TO WHICH AUDIENCES ARE CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN AN ISSUE BEFORE DECIDING HOW AGGRESSIVELY TO RESPOND TO PERPETRATORS OF FAKE NEWS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: THE PRESENT STUDY EXAMINES THE INTERSECTION OF FAKE NEWS AND CRISIS MANAGEMENT IN THE NON-PROFIT SECTOR, WITH AN EMPHASIS ON VARIOUS RESPONSE STRATEGIES AND ISSUE INVOLVEMENT. THIS IS ONE OF THE FIRST ATTEMPTS TO EXPERIMENTALLY INVESTIGATE HOW SOCIAL MEDIA STRATEGIES CAN DEFEND AND PROTECT NON-PROFIT REPUTATION IN THE FAKE NEWS ERA.

497,DISINFORMATION BY DESIGN THE USE OF EVIDENCE COLLAGES AND PLATFORM FILTERING IN A MEDIA MANIPULATION CAMPAIGN,"DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGNS SUCH AS THOSE PERPETRATED BY FAR-RIGHT GROUPS IN THE UNITED STATES SEEK TO ERODE DEMOCRATIC SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS. LOOKING TO UNDERSTAND THESE PHENOMENA, PREVIOUS MODELS OF DISINFORMATION HAVE EMPHASIZED IDENTITY-CONFIRMATION AND MISLEADING PRESENTATION OF FACTS TO EXPLAIN WHY SUCH DISINFORMATION IS SHARED. A RISK OF THESE ACCOUNTS, WHICH CONJURE IMAGES OF ECHO CHAMBERS AND FILTER BUBBLES, IS PORTRAYING PEOPLE WHO ACCEPT DISINFORMATION AS RELATIVELY PASSIVE RECIPIENTS OR CONDUITS. HERE WE CONDUCT A CASE STUDY OF TACTICS OF DISINFORMATION TO SHOW HOW PLATFORM DESIGN AND DECENTRALIZED COMMUNICATION CONTRIBUTE TO ADVANCING THE SPREAD OF DISINFORMATION EVEN WHEN THAT DISINFORMATION IS CONTINUOUSLY AND ACTIVELY CHALLENGED WHERE IT APPEARS. CONTRARY TO A VIEW OF DISINFORMATION FLOWING WITHIN HOMOGENEOUS ECHO CHAMBERS, IN OUR CASE STUDY WE OBSERVE SUBSTANTIAL SKEPTICISM AGAINST DISINFORMATION NARRATIVES AS THEY FORM. TO EXAMINE HOW DISINFORMATION SPREADS AMIDST SKEPTICISM IN THIS CASE, WE EMPLOY A DOCUMENT-DRIVEN MULTI-SITE TRACE ETHNOGRAPHY TO ANALYZE A CONTESTED RUMOR THAT CROSSED ANONYMOUS MESSAGE BOARDS, THE CONSERVATIVE MEDIA ECOSYSTEM, AND OTHER PLATFORMS. WE IDENTIFY TWO IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT FILTERED OUT SKEPTICISM AND CONTESTED EXPLANATIONS, WHICH FACILITATED THE TRANSFORMATION OF THIS RUMOR INTO A DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN: (1) THE AGGREGATION OF INFORMATION INTO EVIDENCE COLLAGESÃ¢â‚¬â€IMAGE FILES THAT AGGREGATE POSITIVE EVIDENCEÃ¢â‚¬â€AND (2) PLATFORM FILTERINGÃ¢â‚¬â€THE DECONTEXTUALIZATION OF INFORMATION AS THESE CLAIMS CROSSED PLATFORMS. OUR FINDINGS PROVIDE AN ELUCIDATION OF Ã¢â‚¬Å“TRADING UP THE CHAINÃ¢â‚¬Â DYNAMICS EXPLORED BY PREVIOUS RESEARCHERS AND A COUNTERPOINT TO THE RELATIVELY MECHANISTIC ACCOUNTS OF PASSIVE DISINFORMATION PROPAGATION THAT DOMINATE THE QUANTITATIVE LITERATURE. WE CONCLUDE WITH A DISCUSSION OF HOW THESE FACTORS RELATE TO THE COMMUNICATION POWER AVAILABLE TO DISPARATE GROUPS AT DIFFERENT TIMES, AS WELL AS PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS FOR INFERRING INTENT FROM SOCIAL MEDIA TRACES AND PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS FOR THE DESIGN OF SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS.

442,TOPOLOGY COMPARISON OF TWITTER DIFFUSION NETWORKS EFFECTIVELY REVEALS MISLEADING INFORMATION,"IN RECENT YEARS, MALICIOUS INFORMATION HAD AN EXPLOSIVE GROWTH IN SOCIAL MEDIA, WITH SERIOUS SOCIAL AND POLITICAL BACKLASHES. RECENT IMPORTANT STUDIES, FEATURING LARGE-SCALE ANALYSES, HAVE PRODUCED DEEPER KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THIS PHENOMENON, SHOWING THAT MISLEADING INFORMATION SPREADS FASTER, DEEPER AND MORE BROADLY THAN FACTUAL INFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA, WHERE ECHO CHAMBERS, ALGORITHMIC AND HUMAN BIASES PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN DIFFUSION NETWORKS. FOLLOWING THESE DIRECTIONS, WE EXPLORE THE POSSIBILITY OF CLASSIFYING NEWS ARTICLES CIRCULATING ON SOCIAL MEDIA BASED EXCLUSIVELY ON A TOPOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF THEIR DIFFUSION NETWORKS. TO THIS AIM WE COLLECTED A LARGE DATASET OF DIFFUSION NETWORKS ON TWITTER PERTAINING TO NEWS ARTICLES PUBLISHED ON TWO DISTINCT CLASSES OF SOURCES, NAMELY OUTLETS THAT CONVEY MAINSTREAM, RELIABLE AND OBJECTIVE INFORMATION AND THOSE THAT FABRICATE AND DISSEMINATE VARIOUS KINDS OF MISLEADING ARTICLES, INCLUDING FALSE NEWS INTENDED TO HARM, SATIRE INTENDED TO MAKE PEOPLE LAUGH, CLICK-BAIT NEWS THAT MAY BE ENTIRELY FACTUAL OR RUMORS THAT ARE UNPROVEN. WE CARRIED OUT AN EXTENSIVE COMPARISON OF THESE NETWORKS USING SEVERAL ALIGNMENT-FREE APPROACHES INCLUDING BASIC NETWORK PROPERTIES, CENTRALITY MEASURES DISTRIBUTIONS, AND NETWORK DISTANCES. WE ACCORDINGLY EVALUATED TO WHAT EXTENT THESE TECHNIQUES ALLOW TO DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN THE NETWORKS ASSOCIATED TO THE AFOREMENTIONED NEWS DOMAINS. OUR RESULTS HIGHLIGHT THAT THE COMMUNITIES OF USERS SPREADING MAINSTREAM NEWS, COMPARED TO THOSE SHARING MISLEADING NEWS, TEND TO SHAPE DIFFUSION NETWORKS WITH SUBTLE YET SYSTEMATIC DIFFERENCES WHICH MIGHT BE EFFECTIVELY EMPLOYED TO IDENTIFY MISLEADING AND HARMFUL INFORMATION.

IN THIS STUDY, WE ATTEMPT TO EXTEND CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THIS TOPIC BY EXPLORING THE DEGREE TO WHICH INDIVIDUAL LEVELS OF IDEOLOGICAL EXTREMITY, SOCIAL TRUST, AND TRUST IN THE NEWS MEDIA ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE DISSEMINATION OF COUNTERMEDIA CONTENT, OR WEB-BASED, IDEOLOGICALLY EXTREME INFORMATION THAT USES FALSE, BIASED, MISLEADING, AND HYPER-PARTISAN CLAIMS TO COUNTER THE KNOWLEDGE PRODUCED BY THE MAINSTREAM NEWS MEDIA. TO INVESTIGATE THESE POSSIBLE ASSOCIATIONS, WE USED A COMBINATION OF SELF-REPORT SURVEY DATA AND TRACE DATA COLLECTED FROM FACEBOOK AND TWITTER.

470,MISINFORMATION DEBUNKING AND CROSSPLATFORM INFORMATION SHARING THROUGH TWITTER DURING HURRICANES HARVEY AND IRMA A CASE STUDY ON SHELTERS AND ID CHECKS,"AS THE INTERNET AND SOCIAL MEDIA CONTINUE TO BECOME INCREASINGLY USED FOR SHARING BREAKING NEWS AND IMPORTANT UPDATES, IT IS WITH GREAT MOTIVATION TO STUDY THE BEHAVIORS OF ONLINE USERS DURING CRISIS EVENTS. ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES WITH OBTAINING INFORMATION ONLINE IS THE VERACITY OF SUCH CONTENT. GIVEN THIS VULNERABILITY, MISINFORMATION BECOMES A VERY DANGEROUS AND REAL THREAT WHEN SPREAD ONLINE. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES MISINFORMATION DEBUNKING EFFORTS AND FILLS THE RESEARCH GAP ON CROSS-PLATFORM INFORMATION SHARING WHEN MISINFORMATION IS SPREAD DURING DISASTERS. THE FALSE RUMOR Ã¢â‚¬Å“IMMIGRATION STATUS IS CHECKED AT SHELTERSÃ¢â‚¬Â SPREAD IN BOTH HURRICANE HARVEY AND HURRICANE IRMA IN 2017 AND WAS ANALYZED IN THIS PAPER BASED ON A COLLECTION OF 12,900 TWEETS. BY STUDYING THE RUMOR CONTROL EFFORTS MADE BY THOUSANDS OF ACCOUNTS, WE FOUND THAT TWITTER USERS RESPOND AND INTERACT THE MOST WITH TWEETS FROM VERIFIED TWITTER ACCOUNTS, AND ESPECIALLY GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS. RESULTS ON SOURCING ANALYSIS SHOW THAT THE MAJORITY OF TWITTER USERS WHO UTILIZE URLS IN THEIR POSTINGS ARE EMPLOYING THE INFORMATION IN THE URLS TO HELP DEBUNK THE FALSE RUMOR. THE MOST FREQUENTLY CITED INFORMATION COMES FROM NEWS AGENCIES WHEN ANALYZING BOTH URLS AND DOMAINS.

494,INFORMATION ON SURGICAL TREATMENT OF BENIGN PROSTATIC HYPERPLASIA ON YOUTUBE IS HIGHLY BIASED AND MISLEADING,"OBJECTIVES: TO ASSESS THE QUALITY OF VIDEOS ON THE SURGICAL TREATMENT OF LOWER URINARY TRACT SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH BENIGN PROSTATIC HYPERPLASIA (LUTS/BPH) AVAILABLE ON YOUTUBE, GIVEN THAT SUCH VIDEO-SHARING PLATFORMS ARE FREQUENTLY USED AS SOURCES OF PATIENT INFORMATION AND THE THERAPEUTIC LANDSCAPE OF LUTS/BPH HAS EVOLVED SUBSTANTIALLY DURING RECENT YEARS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A SYSTEMATIC SEARCH FOR VIDEOS ON YOUTUBE ADDRESSING TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR LUTS/BPH WAS PERFORMED IN MAY 2019. MEASURES ASSESSED INCLUDED BASIC DATA (E.G. NUMBER OF VIEWS), GRADE OF MISINFORMATION AND REPORTING OF CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. THE QUALITY OF CONTENT WAS ANALYSED USING THE VALIDATED DISCERN QUESTIONNAIRE. DATA WERE ANALYSED USING DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 159 VIDEOS WITH A MEDIAN (RANGE) OF 8570 (648Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2Ã‚Â 384Ã‚Â 391) VIEWS WERE INCLUDED IN THE ANALYSIS. ONLY 21 VIDEOS (13.2%) WERE RATED AS CONTAINING NO MISINFORMATION, 26 (16.4%) WERE FREE OF COMMERCIAL BIAS, AND TWO (1.3%) DISCLOSED POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. ACCORDING TO DISCERN, THE MEDIAN OVERALL QUALITY OF THE VIDEOS WAS LOW (2 OUT OF 5 POINTS FOR QUESTION 16). ONLY FOUR OF THE 15 ASSESSED CATEGORIES (BIPOLAR AND HOLMIUM LASER ENUCLEATION OF THE PROSTATE, TRANSURETHRAL RESECTION OF THE PROSTATE AND PATIENT-BASED SEARCH TERMS) WERE SCORED AS HAVING MODERATE MEDIAN OVERALL QUALITY (3 POINTS). CONCLUSION: MOST VIDEOS ON THE SURGICAL TREATMENT OF LUTS/BPH ON YOUTUBE HAD A LOW QUALITY OF CONTENT, PROVIDED MISINFORMATION, WERE SUBJECT TO COMMERCIAL BIAS AND DID NOT REPORT ON CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.

IN STUDY 1, WE TESTED FACT-CHECKER FLAGS, PEER-GENERATED FLAGS, AND A FLAG INDICATING THAT THE PUBLISHER SELF-IDENTIFIED AS A SOURCE OF HUMOR. WE PREDICTED THAT ALL WOULD BE EFFECTIVE, THAT THEIR EFFECTIVENESS WOULD DEPEND ON PRIOR BELIEFS, AND THAT THE SELF-IDENTIFIED HUMOR FLAG WOULD WORK BEST. CONDUCTING A 2-WAVE ONLINE EXPERIMENT (N = 218), WE FOUND THAT SELF-IDENTIFIED HUMOR FLAGS WERE MOST EFFECTIVE, REDUCING BELIEFS AND SHARING INTENTIONS, ESPECIALLY AMONG THOSE PREDISPOSED TO BELIEVE THE POST.

456,TESTING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CORRECTION PLACEMENT AND TYPE ON INSTAGRAM,"DESPITE CONCERNS ABOUT MISINFORMATION ACROSS SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS, LITTLE ATTENTION HAS BEEN PAID TO HOW TO CORRECT MISINFORMATION ON VISUAL PLATFORMS LIKE INSTAGRAM. THIS STUDY USES AN EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN ON A NATIONAL SAMPLE TO TEST TWO FEATURES OF USER-BASED CORRECTION STRATEGIES ON INSTAGRAM FOR A DIVISIVE ISSUE ON WHICH MISINFORMATION ABOUNDS: THE ISSUE OF CLIMATE CHANGE. FIRST, WE UNITE THE INOCULATION AND CORRECTION LITERATURE TO TEST THE EFFICACY OF PREBUNKING CORRECTIONS THAT COME BEFORE EXPOSURE TO THE MISINFORMATION VERSUS DEBUNKING STRATEGIES THAT OCCUR AFTER EXPOSURE. SECOND, WE COMPARE FACT-FOCUSED CORRECTIONS THAT PROVIDE ACCURATE INFORMATION TO REBUT THE MISINFORMATION AGAINST LOGIC-FOCUSED CORRECTIONS THAT HIGHLIGHT THE RHETORICAL FLAW UNDERPINNING THE MISINFORMATION. OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT THESE STRATEGIES INTERSECT TO REDUCE MISPERCEPTIONS. LOGIC-FOCUSED CORRECTIONS EFFECTIVELY REDUCE MISPERCEPTIONS REGARDLESS OF THEIR PLACEMENT BEFORE OR AFTER THE MISINFORMATION, AND APPEAR TO FUNCTION IN PART BY REDUCING PERCEPTIONS OF THE CREDIBILITY OF THE MISINFORMATION POST. FACT-FOCUSED CORRECTIONS ONLY REDUCE MISPERCEPTIONS WHEN THEY OCCUR AFTER THE MISINFORMATION, BUT ARE SEEN AS MORE CREDIBLE THAN LOGIC-FOCUSED CORRECTIONS. WE DISCUSS THE IMPLICATIONS OF OUR FINDINGS FOR UNDERSTANDING THE THEORETICAL MECHANISM BY WHICH CORRECTION CAN OCCUR AND THE PRACTICAL GUIDELINES TO BEST CORRECT MISINFORMATION IN VISUAL SOCIAL MEDIA SPACES.

WE EVALUATE THAT CLAIM THROUGH A COMPARATIVE MULTIMODAL CONTENT ANALYSIS OF THE ISIS VIDEO FLAMES OF WAR AND THE VIDEOS POSTED IN RESPONSE ON THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE'S (USDS) THINK AGAIN TURN AWAY YOUTUBE CHANNEL. OUR FINDINGS SHED LIGHT ON SOME OF THE REASONS WHY THE USDS ANTI-PROPAGANDA VIDEOS ARE LESS RHETORICALLY EFFECTIVE THAN THE ISIS VIDEOS, INCLUDING A ONE-DIMENSIONAL NARRATIVE, A STANCE THAT COULD APPEAR INAUTHENTIC, AND A LACK OF SENSITIVITY TO ISLAMIC CULTURE.

51,DOES KFC SELL RAT ANALYSIS OF TWEETS IN THE WAKE OF A RUMOR OUTBREAK,"PURPOSE: IN THE WAKE OF A RUMOR OUTBREAK, INDIVIDUALS EXCHANGE THREE TYPES OF MESSAGES: RUMOR MESSAGES, COUNTER-RUMOR MESSAGES, AND UNCERTAINTY-EXPRESSING MESSAGES. HOWEVER, THE PROPERTIES OF THE THREE TYPES OF MESSAGES ARE RELATIVELY UNKNOWN PARTICULARLY IN THE SOCIAL MEDIA CONTEXT. HENCE, THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXAMINE THESE THREE TYPES OF MESSAGES POSTED ON SOCIAL MEDIA IN THE WAKE OF A RUMOR OUTBREAK. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: DATA INCLUDED TWEETS POSTED AFTER THE OUTBREAK OF A RUMOR THAT WRONGLY ACCUSED THE FAST FOOD CHAIN KENTUCKY FRIED CHICKEN (KFC) FOR SELLING RATS INSTEAD OF CHICKEN. USING A DEDUCTIVE APPROACH, CODES WERE DERIVED VIA CONTENT ANALYSIS ON THE TWEETS. VOLUME AND EXPOSURE OF TWEETS WERE ALSO EXAMINED. FINDINGS: COUNTER-RUMOR TWEETS (52 PERCENT) OUTNUMBERED RUMORS TWEETS (32 PERCENT) AND UNCERTAINTY-EXPRESSING TWEETS (16 PERCENT). EMOTIONS AND PERSONAL INVOLVEMENT WERE ABUNDANT IN RUMOR TWEETS. EXPRESSIONS OF CREDENCE AND REFERENCES TO URLS WERE HIGH IN COUNTER-RUMOR TWEETS. SOCIAL TIES WERE FOUND WIDELY IN UNCERTAINTY-EXPRESSING TWEETS. THE HIGH VOLUME AND EXPOSURE OF COUNTER-RUMOR TWEETS COMPARED WITH THOSE OF EITHER RUMOR TWEETS OR UNCERTAINTY-EXPRESSING TWEETS HIGHLIGHT THE POTENTIAL OF COUNTER-RUMORS TO MITIGATE RUMORS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: THIS RESEARCH VENTURES INTO A RELATIVELY UNEXPLORED TERRITORY BY CONCURRENTLY EXAMINING RUMOR MESSAGES, COUNTER-RUMOR MESSAGES AND UNCERTAINTY-EXPRESSING MESSAGES IN THE WAKE OF A RUMOR OUTBREAK.

87,THE RUMOUR SPECTRUM,"RUMOUR IS AN OLD SOCIAL PHENOMENON USED IN POLITICS AND OTHER PUBLIC SPACES. IT HAS BEEN STUDIED FOR ONLY HUNDRED YEARS BY SOCIOLOGISTS AND PSYCHOLOGISTS BY QUALITATIVE MEANS. SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS OPEN NEW OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE QUANTITATIVE ANALYSES. WE SCANNED ALL SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE TO FIND RELEVANT FEATURES. WE MADE A QUANTITATIVE SCREENING OF SOME SPECIFIC RUMOURS (IN FRENCH AND IN ENGLISH). FIRSTLY, WE IDENTIFIED SOME SOURCES OF INFORMATION TO FIND THEM. SECONDLY, WE COMPILED DIFFERENT REFERENCE, RUMOURING AND EVENT DATASETS. THIRDLY, WE CONSIDERED TWO FACETS OF A RUMOUR: THE WAY IT CAN SPREAD TO OTHER USERS, AND THE SYNTAGMATIC CONTENT THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE SPECIFIC FOR A RUMOUR. WE FOUND 53 FEATURES, CLUSTERED INTO SIX CATEGORIES, WHICH ARE ABLE TO DESCRIBE A RUMOUR MESSAGE. THE SPREAD OF A RUMOUR IS MULTI-HARMONIC HAVING DIFFERENT FREQUENCIES AND SPIKES, AND CAN SURVIVE SEVERAL YEARS. COMBINATIONS OF WORDS (N-GRAMS AND SKIP-GRAMS) ARE NOT TYPICAL OF EXPRESSIVITY BETWEEN RUMOURS AND NEWS BUT STUDY OF LEXICAL TRANSITION FROM A TIME PERIOD TO THE NEXT GOES IN THE SENSE OF TRANSMISSION PATTERN AS DESCRIBED BY ALLPORT THEORY OF TRANSMISSION.

135,WHAT THE FAKE ASSESSING THE EXTENT OF NETWORKED POLITICAL SPAMMING AND BOTS IN THE PROPAGATION OF FAKENEWS ON TWITTER,"PURPOSE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXAMINE ONE OF THE LARGEST DATA SETS ON THE HASHTAG USE OF #FAKENEWS THAT COMPRISES OVER 14M TWEETS SENT BY MORE THAN 2.4M USERS. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: TWEETS REFERENCING THE HASHTAG (#FAKENEWS) WERE COLLECTED FOR A PERIOD OF OVER ONE YEAR FROM JANUARY 3 TO MAY 7 OF 2018. BOT DETECTION TOOLS WERE EMPLOYED, AND THE MOST RETWEETED POSTS, MOST MENTIONS AND MOST HASHTAGS AS WELL AS THE TOP 50 MOST ACTIVE USERS IN TERMS OF THE FREQUENCY OF THEIR TWEETS WERE ANALYZED. FINDINGS: THE MAJORITY OF THE TOP 50 TWITTER USERS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE AUTOMATED BOTS, WHILE CERTAIN USERSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ POSTS LIKE THAT ARE SENT BY PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP DOMINATE THE MOST RETWEETED POSTS THAT ALWAYS ASSOCIATE MAINSTREAM MEDIA WITH FAKE NEWS. THE MOST USED WORDS AND HASHTAGS SHOW THAT MAJOR NEWS ORGANIZATIONS ARE FREQUENTLY REFERENCED WITH A FOCUS ON CNN THAT IS OFTEN MENTIONED IN NEGATIVE WAYS. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: THE RESEARCH STUDY IS LIMITED TO THE EXAMINATION OF TWITTER DATA, WHILE ETHNOGRAPHIC METHODS LIKE INTERVIEWS OR SURVEYS ARE FURTHER NEEDED TO COMPLEMENT THESE FINDINGS. THOUGH THE DATA REPORTED HERE DO NOT PROVE DIRECT EFFECTS, THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE RESEARCH PROVIDE A VITAL FRAMEWORK FOR ASSESSING AND DIAGNOSING THE NETWORKED SPAMMERS AND MAIN ACTORS THAT HAVE BEEN PIVOTAL IN SHAPING DISCOURSES AROUND FAKE NEWS ON SOCIAL MEDIA. THESE DISCOURSES, WHICH ARE SOMETIMES ASSISTED BY BOTS, CAN CREATE A POTENTIAL INFLUENCE ON AUDIENCES AND THEIR TRUST IN MAINSTREAM MEDIA AND UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT FAKE NEWS IS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: THIS PAPER OFFERS RESULTS ON ONE OF THE FIRST EMPIRICAL RESEARCH STUDIES ON THE PROPAGATION OF FAKE NEWS DISCOURSE ON SOCIAL MEDIA BY SHEDDING LIGHT ON THE MOST ACTIVE TWITTER USERS WHO DISCUSS AND MENTION THE TERM Ã¢â‚¬Å“#FAKENEWSÃ¢â‚¬Â IN CONNECTION TO OTHER NEWS ORGANIZATIONS, PARTIES AND RELATED FIGURES.

166,TRUSTWORTHY HEALTHRELATED TWEETS ON SOCIAL MEDIA IN SAUDI ARABIA TWEET METADATA ANALYSIS,"BACKGROUND: SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN THE DISSEMINATION OF HEALTH INFORMATION. HOWEVER, EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT A HIGH PROPORTION OF TWITTER POSTS (IE, TWEETS) ARE NOT NECESSARILY ACCURATE, AND MANY STUDIES SUGGEST THAT TWEETS DO NOT NEED TO BE ACCURATE, OR AT LEAST EVIDENCE BASED, TO RECEIVE TRACTION. THIS IS A DANGEROUS COMBINATION IN THE SPHERE OF HEALTH INFORMATION. OBJECTIVE: THE FIRST OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO EXAMINE HEALTH-RELATED TWEETS ORIGINATING FROM SAUDI ARABIA IN TERMS OF THEIR ACCURACY. THE SECOND OBJECTIVE IS TO FIND FACTORS THAT RELATE TO THE ACCURACY AND DISSEMINATION OF THESE TWEETS, THEREBY ENABLING THE IDENTIFICATION OF WAYS TO ENHANCE THE DISSEMINATION OF ACCURATE TWEETS. THE INITIAL FINDINGS FROM THIS STUDY AND METHODOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENTS WILL THEN BE EMPLOYED IN A LARGER-SCALE STUDY THAT WILL ADDRESS THESE ISSUES IN MORE DETAIL. METHODS: A HEALTH LEXICON WAS USED TO EXTRACT HEALTH-RELATED TWEETS USING THE TWITTER APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE AND THE RESULTS WERE FURTHER FILTERED MANUALLY. A TOTAL OF 300 TWEETS WERE EACH LABELED BY TWO MEDICAL DOCTORS; THE DOCTORS AGREED THAT 109 TWEETS WERE EITHER ACCURATE OR INACCURATE. OTHER MEASURES WERE TAKEN FROM THESE TWEETS' METADATA TO SEE IF THERE WAS ANY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE MEASURES AND EITHER THE ACCURACY OR THE DISSEMINATION OF THE TWEETS. THE ENTIRE RANGE OF THIS METADATA WAS ANALYZED USING PYTHON, VERSION 3.6.5 (PYTHON SOFTWARE FOUNDATION), TO ANSWER THE RESEARCH QUESTIONS POSED. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 34 OUT OF 109 TWEETS (31.2%) IN THE DATASET USED IN THIS STUDY WERE CLASSIFIED AS UNTRUSTWORTHY HEALTH INFORMATION. THESE CAME MAINLY FROM USERS WITH A NON-HEALTH CARE BACKGROUND AND SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS THAT HAD NO CORRESPONDING PHYSICAL (IE, ORGANIZATION) MANIFESTATION. UNSURPRISINGLY, WE FOUND THAT TRADITIONALLY TRUSTED HEALTH SOURCES WERE MORE LIKELY TO TWEET ACCURATE HEALTH INFORMATION THAN OTHER USERS. LIKEWISE, THESE PROVISIONAL RESULTS SUGGEST THAT TWEETS POSTED IN THE MORNING ARE MORE TRUSTWORTHY THAN TWEETS POSTED AT NIGHT, POSSIBLY CORRESPONDING TO OFFICIAL AND CASUAL POSTS, RESPECTIVELY. OUR RESULTS ALSO SUGGEST THAT THE CROWD WAS QUITE GOOD AT IDENTIFYING TRUSTWORTHY INFORMATION SOURCES, AS EVIDENCED BY THE NUMBER OF TIMES A TWEET'S AUTHOR WAS TAGGED AS FAVORITED BY THE COMMUNITY. CONCLUSIONS: THE RESULTS INDICATE SOME INITIALLY SURPRISING FACTORS THAT MIGHT CORRELATE WITH THE ACCURACY OF TWEETS AND THEIR DISSEMINATION. FOR EXAMPLE, THE TIME A TWEET WAS POSTED CORRELATED WITH ITS ACCURACY, WHICH MAY REFLECT A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PROFESSIONAL (IE, MORNING) AND HOBBYIST (IE, EVENING) TWEETS. MORE SURPRISINGLY, TWEETS CONTAINING A KASHIDA-A DECORATIVE ELEMENT IN ARABIC WRITING USED TO JUSTIFY THE TEXT WITHIN LINES-WERE MORE LIKELY TO BE DISSEMINATED THROUGH RETWEETS. THESE FINDINGS WILL BE FURTHER ASSESSED USING DATA ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES ON A MUCH LARGER DATASET IN FUTURE WORK.

WE ASSESS CLAIMS THAT THE IRA SOUGHT EITHER TO (1) SUPPORT DONALD TRUMP OR (2) SOW DISCORD AMONG THE U.S. PUBLIC BY ANALYZING HYPERLINKS CONTAINED IN 108,781 IRA TWEETS. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT ALTHOUGH IRA ACCOUNTS PROMOTED LINKS TO BOTH SIDES OF THE IDEOLOGICAL SPECTRUM, Ã¢â‚¬Å“CONSERVATIVEÃ¢â‚¬Â TROLLS WERE MORE ACTIVE THAN Ã¢â‚¬Å“LIBERALÃ¢â‚¬Â ONES. THE IRA ALSO SHARED CONTENT ACROSS SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS, PARTICULARLY YOUTUBEÃ¢â‚¬â€THE SECOND-MOST LINKED DESTINATION AMONG IRA TWEETS. ALTHOUGH OVERALL NEWS CONTENT SHARED BY TROLLS LEANED MODERATE TO CONSERVATIVE, WE FIND TROLL ACCOUNTS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE IDEOLOGICAL SPECTRUM, AND THESE ACCOUNTS MAINTAIN THEIR POLITICAL ALIGNMENT. LINKS TO YOUTUBE VIDEOS WERE DECIDEDLY CONSERVATIVE, HOWEVER. WHILE MIXED, THIS EVIDENCE IS CONSISTENT WITH THE IRAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S SUPPORTING THE REPUBLICAN CAMPAIGN, BUT THE IRAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S STRATEGY WAS MULTIFACETED, WITH AN IDEOLOGICAL DIVISION OF LABOR AMONG ACCOUNTS.

AMERICANS INCREASINGLY GET INFORMATION FROM SOCIAL MEDIA, PUBLIC DISTRUST IN THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA IS GROWING AND Ã¢â‚¬Å“FAKE NEWSÃ¢â‚¬Â IS AN IMPORTANT NEW PHENOMENON. THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE TRUST IN SCIENTIFIC CLAIMS POSTED VIA SOCIAL MEDIA, INCLUDING THE USE OF HYPERLINKS AND READERS' VALUES. THE PAPER DESCRIBES A CROWDSOURCING-BASED EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN USING AMAZON'S MECHANICAL TURK PLATFORM. THE CORE OF THE EXPERIMENT WAS A SET OF 10 SCIENTIFIC FINDINGS REPORTED IN OPEN-ACCESS, PEER-REVIEWED SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS, WHICH WERE IN TURN LINKED TO IN ARTICLES IN BOTH THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA AND Ã¢â‚¬Å“FAKE NEWSÃ¢â‚¬Â SITES. DATA ANALYSIS INVOLVED EXPLORATION OF RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN TRUST AND THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF HYPERLINKS, AND BETWEEN TRUST AND HUMAN VALUES USING NONPARAMETRIC STATISTICAL METHODS. IN TERMS OF THE INFLUENCE OF HYPERLINKS ON TRUST, INCLUSION OF HYPERLINKS TO SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS, MAINSTREAM MEDIA ARTICLES, AND EVEN HIDDEN URLS LED TO HIGHER TRUST THAN HYPERLINKS TO Ã¢â‚¬Å“FAKE NEWSÃ¢â‚¬Â SITES OR POSTS WITHOUT HYPERLINKS (P < 0.001). PARTICIPANTS WHO CLICKED ON HYPERLINKS TO SCIENTIFIC ARTICLES PLACED HIGHER TRUST IN THE CLAIMS THAN THOSE WHO DID NOT (P < 0.001). IN TERMS OF THE INFLUENCE OF VALUES ON TRUST, VALUES HAD THE MOST IMPACT IN CASES WHERE INDIVIDUALS SAW, BUT DECIDED NOT TO CLICK ON, HYPERLINKS; THIS FINDING SEEMS TO INDICATE THAT IN THE ABSENCE OF FIRSTHAND EXAMINATION OF THE HYPERLINKED SITES, PARTICIPANTS TEND TO RELY MORE HEAVILY ON THEIR VALUES TO DETERMINE THEIR TRUST IN A SCIENTIFIC CLAIM.

IN THIS LARGE-SCALE STUDY OF NEWS IN SOCIAL MEDIA, WE ANALYZE 11 MILLION POSTS AND INVESTIGATE THE PROPAGATION BEHAVIOR OF USERS THAT DIRECTLY INTERACT WITH NEWS ACCOUNTS IDENTIFIED AS SPREADING TRUSTED VERSUS MALICIOUS CONTENT. UNLIKE PREVIOUS WORK, WHICH LOOKS AT SPECIFIC RUMORS, TOPICS, OR EVENTS, WE CONSIDER ALL CONTENT PROPAGATED BY VARIOUS NEWS SOURCES. MOREOVER, WE ANALYZE AND CONTRAST POPULATION VERSUS SUBPOPULATION BEHAVIOR (BY DEMOGRAPHICS) WHEN SPREADING MISINFORMATION, AND DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE TWO TYPES OF PROPAGATION, I.E., DIRECT RETWEETS AND MENTIONS. OUR EVALUATION EXAMINES HOW EVENLY, HOW MANY, HOW QUICKLY, AND WHICH USERS PROPAGATE CONTENT FROM VARIOUS TYPES OF NEWS SOURCES ON TWITTER. OUR ANALYSIS HAS IDENTIFIED SEVERAL KEY DIFFERENCES IN PROPAGATION BEHAVIOR FROM TRUSTED VERSUS SUSPICIOUS NEWS SOURCES. THESE INCLUDE HIGH INEQUITY IN THE DIFFUSION RATE BASED ON THE SOURCE OF DISINFORMATION, WITH A SMALL GROUP OF HIGHLY ACTIVE USERS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MAJORITY OF DISINFORMATION SPREAD OVERALL AND WITHIN EACH DEMOGRAPHIC. ANALYSIS BY DEMOGRAPHICS SHOWED THAT USERS WITH LOWER ANNUAL INCOME AND EDUCATION SHARE MORE FROM DISINFORMATION SOURCES COMPARED TO THEIR COUNTERPARTS. NEWS CONTENT IS SHARED SIGNIFICANTLY MORE QUICKLY FROM TRUSTED, CONSPIRACY, AND DISINFORMATION SOURCES COMPARED TO CLICKBAIT AND PROPAGANDA. OLDER USERS PROPAGATE NEWS FROM TRUSTED SOURCES MORE QUICKLY THAN YOUNGER USERS, BUT THEY SHARE FROM SUSPICIOUS SOURCES AFTER LONGER DELAYS. FINALLY, USERS WHO INTERACT WITH CLICKBAIT AND CONSPIRACY SOURCES ARE LIKELY TO SHARE FROM PROPAGANDA ACCOUNTS, BUT NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

AGAINST THIS BACKDROP, THIS STUDY EXAMINED THE CONDITIONAL INDIRECT EFFECT OF SOCIAL MEDIA USE AND DISCUSSION HETEROGENEITY PREFERENCE ON COVID-19-RELATED MISINFORMATION BELIEFS IN THE UNITED STATES, USING A NATIONAL SURVEY. FINDINGS SUGGESTED THAT SOCIAL MEDIA USE WAS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH MISINFORMATION BELIEFS, WHILE DISCUSSION HETEROGENEITY PREFERENCE WAS NEGATIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH MISINFORMATION BELIEFS. FURTHERMORE, WORRY OF COVID-19 WAS FOUND TO BE A SIGNIFICANT MEDIATOR AS BOTH ASSOCIATIONS BECAME MORE SIGNIFICANT WHEN MEDIATED THROUGH WORRY. IN ADDITION, FAITH IN SCIENTISTS SERVED AS A MODERATOR THAT MITIGATED THE INDIRECT EFFECT OF DISCUSSION HETEROGENEITY PREFERENCE ON MISINFORMATION BELIEFS.

FACILITATING ITS PROGRESSION HAS BEEN POLITICALLY AND ECONOMICALLY MOTIVATED CULPRITS WHO HAVE OSTENSIBLY TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE DIGITAL FREEDOMS AVAILABLE TO THEM. AT THE HEART OF THESE FREEDOMS LIE SOCIAL MEDIA ORGANISATIONS THAT ONLY A FEW YEARS EARLIER TECHNO-OPTIMISTS WERE IDENTIFYING AS CATALYSTS OF AN ENHANCED DIGITAL DEMOCRACY. IN ORDER TO CURTAIL THE EROSION OF INFORMATION, POLICY REFORM WILL NO DOUBT BE ESSENTIAL. THE UK'S DEPARTMENT OF DIGITAL, CULTURE, MEDIA AND SPORT DISINFORMATION AND Ã¢â‚¬ËœFAKE NEWSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ REPORT AND CAIRNCROSS REVIEW, AND THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION'S REPORT ON DISINFORMATION ARE THREE RECENT EXAMPLES SEEKING TO INVESTIGATE HOW PRECISELY SUCH REFORM POLICY MIGHT BE IMPLEMENTED.

551,WHO FALLS FOR RUMOR INFLUENCE OF PERSONALITY TRAITS ON FALSE RUMOR BELIEF,"WHILE SOCIAL MEDIA MAKES INFORMATION EASILY ACCESSIBLE, IT ALSO BREEDS UNPRECEDENTED QUANTITIES OF FALSE RUMORS THAT INDIVIDUALS FREQUENTLY FALL PREY TO. THERE HAVE BEEN INCREASING EFFORTS TO COMBAT RUMORS, YET THE FIRST BATTLE IN THIS WAR WOULD BE TARGETING THE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE. HOWEVER, SYSTEMATIC UNDERSTANDING OF ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS AND RUMOR BELIEF IS STILL LACKING. WITH A NATIONAL SURVEY IN CHINA (N = 11,551), WE INVESTIGATED RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS' BIG FIVE PERSONALITY TRAITS AND THEIR BELIEFS IN FALSE RUMORS CIRCULATING ON SOCIAL MEDIA. CORRELATIONS AND MULTIPLE REGRESSION MODELS SHOWED THAT PEOPLE HIGH IN NEUROTICISM AND EXTRAVERSION WERE THE MOST VULNERABLE TO RUMORS. FURTHERMORE, DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS, SUCH AS BEING FEMALE AND HAVING LESS EDUCATION WERE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER RUMOR BELIEF. THE FINDINGS ENHANCE UNDERSTANDING OF DISPOSITIONAL FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH PEOPLE'S INFORMATION DECISIONS AND PROVIDE GUIDANCE FOR ANTI-RUMOR CAMPAIGNS.

12,THE RELEVANCE OF THE SOCIAL NETWORKING MEDIA IN EBOLA VIRUS DISEASE PREVENTION AND CONTROL IN SOUTHWESTERN NIGERIA,"INTRODUCTION: THE SOCIAL MEDIA (SM) IS FAST BECOMING A HUGE AVENUE TO CREATE AND SPREAD HEALTH AWARENESS AMONGST YOUTHS. MEANWHILE NEWS SURROUNDING THE ON-GOING EBOLA VIRUS DISEASE (EVD) OUTBREAK IN WEST AFRICA ARE FRIGHTENING. THIS STUDY ASSESSED THE RELEVANCE OF THE SOCIAL NETWORKING MEDIA IN SPREADING AWARENESS ABOUT EVD PREVENTION AND CONTROL IN SOUTHWESTERN NIGERIA.METHODS: DESCRIPTIVE CROSS SECTIONAL STUDY AMONG 400 YOUTHS SELECTED USING MULTISTAGE SAMPLING METHOD. RESEARCH INSTRUMENTS USED WERE SEMI STRUCTURED SELF ADMINISTERED QUESTIONNAIRES THAT WERE ANALYZED USING THE SPSS SOFTWARE VERSION 17.0.RESULTS: THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY (95.0%) OF RESPONDENTS WERE MEMBERS OF A SOCIAL NETWORK. SEVERAL MISCONCEPTIONS TRAILED THE SPREAD OF INFORMATION ABOUT EVD. THOUGH ONLY 21(7.3%) BOTHERED TO ASCERTAIN THE RELIABILITY OF SUCH INFORMATION BEFORE USE, 332 (83.0%) BELIEVED THAT SM CAN ALSO BE USED TO DISPEL RUMOURS ON HEALTH INFORMATION, 337(84.3%) SAID THEY WOULD LIKE THE USE OF SM REGULATED, WHILE 206 (51.6%) STILL BELIEVED THAT SM IS EFFECTIVE IN DISSEMINATING HEALTH INFORMATION AMONG YOUTHS. ONLY 79.4% HAD GOOD KNOWLEDGE OF EVD, AND 30.7% OF RESPONDENTS HAD MISINFORMATION ABOUT EVD. DETERMINANTS OF GOOD LEVEL OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT EVD THROUGH SM CONTACTS INCLUDE BEING A MALE, HAVING SM AS THE FIRST SOURCE OF INFORMATION ON EVD AND BELIEVING THAT SM COULD ASSIST TO DISSEMINATE AND IMPROVE HEALTH INFORMATION.CONCLUSION: MISCONCEPTIONS SPREAD THROUGH THE SM FUELLED THE ONGOING EVD OUTBREAK IN WEST AFRICA.

56,THE SOCIAL REPORTER IN ACTION AN ANALYSIS OF THE PRACTICE AND DISCOURSE OF ANDY CARVIN,"THIS STUDY ANALYZED JOURNALIST ANDY CARVINÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S LIVE COVERAGE ON TWITTER ALONG WITH HIS DISCOURSE ON JOURNALISM AND SOCIAL REPORTING. CARVIN WAS CHOSEN AS THE SUBJECT FOR STUDY AS HE IS PERHAPS THE MOST PROMINENT EXAMPLE OF THE PRACTICE OF JOURNALISM BASED ON EMERGING TECHNIQUES OF COLLABORATIVE VERIFICATION, TRANSPARENCY AND CO-CREATION. A TEXTUAL ANALYSIS OF 3188 TWEETS PUBLISHED BY THE JOURNALIST BETWEEN 11 NOVEMBER 2014 AND 21 JANUARY 2015 WAS CONDUCTED TO INVESTIGATE HIS TECHNIQUES, PARTICULARLY IN TERMS OF VERIFICATION AND CROWDSOURCING. THE ELEMENTS OF JOURNALISM IN CARVINÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S DISCOURSE AND PRACTICE ARE DISCUSSED FOLLOWING KOVACH AND ROSENSTIELÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S WORK ON THE ESSENTIAL PRINCIPLES FOR JOURNALISM PRACTICE. FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT A SOCIAL MEDIA JOURNALIST CAN INTEGRATE BOTH COLLABORATIVE REPORTING AND ESTABLISHED JOURNALISTIC VALUES OF ACCURACY, TRUST AND VERIFICATION, WITH THE COMMUNITY ACTING AS A DISTRIBUTED AND NETWORKED NEWSROOM. RESULTS SHOW THE USE OF SPECIFIC AND EFFECTIVE TECHNIQUES TO OVERCOME MISINFORMATION AND SERVE AS A TRUSTED NODE IN THE NETWORK. THIS STUDY CONTRIBUTES TO THE EMERGING BODY OF WORK THAT ADDRESSES HOW JOURNALISTIC PRACTICE IS EVOLVING AND ADAPTING IN NETWORKED AND SHARED MEDIA ENVIRONMENTS, WHERE THE JOURNALIST PLAYS A VITAL ROLE AS A MEDIATOR OF INFORMATION, BUT AS ONE OF MANY VOICES.

275,THOUGHT ID SHARE FIRST AND OTHER CONSPIRACY THEORY TWEETS FROM THE COVID19 INFODEMIC EXPLORATORY STUDY,"BACKGROUND: THE COVID-19 OUTBREAK HAS LEFT MANY PEOPLE ISOLATED WITHIN THEIR HOMES; THESE PEOPLE ARE TURNING TO SOCIAL MEDIA FOR NEWS AND SOCIAL CONNECTION, WHICH LEAVES THEM VULNERABLE TO BELIEVING AND SHARING MISINFORMATION. HEALTH-RELATED MISINFORMATION THREATENS ADHERENCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH MESSAGING, AND MONITORING ITS SPREAD ON SOCIAL MEDIA IS CRITICAL TO UNDERSTANDING THE EVOLUTION OF IDEAS THAT HAVE POTENTIALLY NEGATIVE PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACTS. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO USE TWITTER DATA TO EXPLORE METHODS TO CHARACTERIZE AND CLASSIFY FOUR COVID-19 CONSPIRACY THEORIES AND TO PROVIDE CONTEXT FOR EACH OF THESE CONSPIRACY THEORIES THROUGH THE FIRST 5 MONTHS OF THE PANDEMIC. METHODS: WE BEGAN WITH A CORPUS OF COVID-19 TWEETS (APPROXIMATELY 120 MILLION) SPANNING LATE JANUARY TO EARLY MAY 2020. WE FIRST FILTERED TWEETS USING REGULAR EXPRESSIONS (N=1.8 MILLION) AND USED RANDOM FOREST CLASSIFICATION MODELS TO IDENTIFY TWEETS RELATED TO FOUR CONSPIRACY THEORIES. OUR CLASSIFIED DATA SETS WERE THEN USED IN DOWNSTREAM SENTIMENT ANALYSIS AND DYNAMIC TOPIC MODELING TO CHARACTERIZE THE LINGUISTIC FEATURES OF COVID-19 CONSPIRACY THEORIES AS THEY EVOLVE OVER TIME. RESULTS: ANALYSIS USING MODEL-LABELED DATA WAS BENEFICIAL FOR INCREASING THE PROPORTION OF DATA MATCHING MISINFORMATION INDICATORS. RANDOM FOREST CLASSIFIER METRICS VARIED ACROSS THE FOUR CONSPIRACY THEORIES CONSIDERED (F1 SCORES BETWEEN 0.347 AND 0.857); THIS PERFORMANCE INCREASED AS THE GIVEN CONSPIRACY THEORY WAS MORE NARROWLY DEFINED. WE SHOWED THAT MISINFORMATION TWEETS DEMONSTRATE MORE NEGATIVE SENTIMENT WHEN COMPARED TO NONMISINFORMATION TWEETS AND THAT THEORIES EVOLVE OVER TIME, INCORPORATING DETAILS FROM UNRELATED CONSPIRACY THEORIES AS WELL AS REAL-WORLD EVENTS. CONCLUSIONS: ALTHOUGH WE FOCUS HERE ON HEALTH-RELATED MISINFORMATION, THIS COMBINATION OF APPROACHES IS NOT SPECIFIC TO PUBLIC HEALTH AND IS VALUABLE FOR CHARACTERIZING MISINFORMATION IN GENERAL, WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP IN CREATING TARGETED MESSAGING TO COUNTERACT ITS SPREAD. INITIAL MESSAGING SHOULD AIM TO PREEMPT GENERALIZED MISINFORMATION BEFORE IT BECOMES WIDESPREAD, WHILE LATER MESSAGING WILL NEED TO TARGET EVOLVING CONSPIRACY THEORIES AND THE NEW FACETS OF EACH AS THEY BECOME INCORPORATED.

423,BEYOND MISREPRESENTATION VISUALS IN COVID19 MISINFORMATION,"THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES ONE OF THE FIRST ANALYSES OF VISUALS IN MISINFORMATION CONCERNING COVID-19. A MIXED-METHODS ANALYSIS OF NINETY-SIX EXAMPLES OF VISUALS IN MISINFORMATION RATED FALSE OR MISLEADING BY INDEPENDENT PROFESSIONAL FACT-CHECKERS FROM THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2020 IDENTIFIES AND EXAMINES SIX FRAMES AND THREE DISTINCT FUNCTIONS OF VISUALS IN PIECES OF MISINFORMATION: HOW VISUALS ILLUSTRATE AND SELECTIVELY EMPHASIZE ARGUMENTS AND CLAIMS, PURPORT TO PRESENT EVIDENCE FOR CLAIMS, AND IMPERSONATE SUPPOSEDLY AUTHORITATIVE SOURCES FOR CLAIMS. NOTABLY, VISUALS IN MORE THAN HALF OF THE PIECES OF MISINFORMATION ANALYZED EXPLICITLY SERVE AS EVIDENCE FOR FALSE CLAIMS, MOST OF WHICH ARE MISLABELLED RATHER THAN MANIPULATED. WHILE THIS ANALYSIS UNCOVERED A SMALL NUMBER OF MANIPULATED VISUALS, ALL WERE PRODUCED USING SIMPLE TOOLS; THERE WERE NO EXAMPLES OF Ã¢â‚¬Å“DEEPFAKESÃ¢â‚¬Â OR OTHER ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE-BASED TECHNIQUES. IN RECOGNIZING THE DIVERSE FUNCTIONS OF VISUALS IN MISINFORMATION AND DRAWING ON RECENT LITERATURE ON SCIENTIFIC VISUALIZATION, THIS ARTICLE DEMONSTRATES THE VALUE IN BOTH ATTENDING TO VISUAL CONTENT IN MISINFORMATION AND EXPANDING OUR FOCUS BEYOND A CONCERN WITH ONLY THE REPRESENTATIONAL ASPECTS AND FUNCTIONS OF MISINFORMATION.

466,VIRAL MISINFORMATION AND ECHO CHAMBERS THE DIFFUSION OF RUMORS ABOUT GENETICALLY MODIFIED ORGANISMS ON SOCIAL MEDIA,"PURPOSE: THE SPREAD OF RUMORS ON SOCIAL MEDIA HAS CAUSED INCREASING CONCERNS ABOUT AN UNDER-INFORMED OR EVEN MISINFORMED PUBLIC WHEN IT COMES TO SCIENTIFIC ISSUES. HOWEVER, RESEARCHERS HAVE RARELY INVESTIGATED THEIR DIFFUSION IN NON-WESTERN CONTEXTS. THIS STUDY AIMS TO SYSTEMATICALLY EXAMINE THE CONTENT AND NETWORK STRUCTURE OF RUMOR-RELATED DISCUSSIONS AROUND GENETICALLY MODIFIED ORGANISMS (GMOS) ON CHINESE SOCIAL MEDIA. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: THIS STUDY IDENTIFIED 21,837 RUMOR-RELATED POSTS OF GMOS ON WEIBO, ONE OF CHINA'S MOST POPULAR SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS. AN APPROACH COMBINING SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS AND CONTENT ANALYSIS WAS EMPLOYED TO CLASSIFY USER ATTITUDES TOWARD RUMORS, MEASURE THE LEVEL OF HOMOPHILY OF THEIR ATTITUDES AND EXAMINE THE NATURE OF THEIR INTERACTIONS. FINDINGS: THOUGH A CERTAIN LEVEL OF HOMOPHILY EXISTED IN THE INTERACTION NETWORKS, REFERRING TO THE OBSERVED ECHO CHAMBER EFFECT, WEIBO ALSO SERVED AS A PUBLIC FORUM FOR GMO DISCUSSIONS IN WHICH CROSS-CUTTING TIES BETWEEN COMMUNITIES EXISTED. A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF INTERACTIONS EMERGED BETWEEN THE PRO- AND ANTI-GMO CAMPS, AND MOST OF THEM INVOLVED PROVIDING OR REQUESTING INFORMATION, WHICH COULD MITIGATE THE LIKELIHOOD OF OPINION POLARIZATION. MOREOVER, THIS STUDY REVEALED THE DECLINING ROLE OF TRADITIONAL OPINION LEADERS AND POINTED TOWARD THE NEED FOR ALTERNATIVE STRATEGIES FOR EFFICIENT FACT-CHECKING. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: IN GENERAL, THE FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY SUGGESTED THAT MICROBLOGGING PLATFORMS SUCH AS WEIBO CAN FUNCTION AS PUBLIC FORUMS FOR DISCUSSING GMOS THAT EXPOSE USERS TO IDEOLOGICALLY CROSS-CUTTING VIEWPOINTS. THIS STUDY STANDS TO PROVIDE IMPORTANT INSIGHTS INTO THE VIRAL PROCESSES OF SCIENTIFIC RUMORS ON SOCIAL MEDIA.

492,FICTION FALSEHOODS AND FEW FACTS CROSSSECTIONAL STUDY ON THE CONTENTRELATED QUALITY OF ATOPIC ECZEMARELATED VIDEOS ON YOUTUBE,"BACKGROUND: IN RECENT YEARS, YOUTUBE HAS BECOME A RECOGNIZED SOURCE OF MEDICAL INFORMATION FOR HEALTH CARE CONSUMERS. ALTHOUGH YOUTUBE HAS ADVANTAGES IN THIS CONTEXT, THERE ARE POTENTIAL DANGERS AS VIDEOS MAY CONTAIN NONSCIENTIFIC, MISLEADING, OR EVEN HARMFUL INFORMATION. OBJECTIVE: AS LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT YOUTUBE AS A SOURCE OF INFORMATION ON ATOPIC DERMATITIS (AD), WE INVESTIGATED THE CONTENT-RELATED QUALITY OF AD VIDEOS AND THEIR PERCEPTION AMONG YOUTUBE USERS. METHODS: THE QUALITY OF THE 100 MOST VIEWED AD VIDEOS WAS ASSESSED BY USING THE GLOBAL QUALITY SCALE (GQS) AND THE DISCERN INSTRUMENT. VIDEOS WERE CLASSIFIED AS ""USEFUL,"" ""MISLEADING,"" AND ""POTENTIALLY HARMFUL,"" AND THE CORRELATIONS OF VIEWERS' RATINGS (LIKES) WITH THE GQS AND DISCERN SCORES WERE ASSESSED. RESULTS: AMONG THE 100 VIDEOS, 68.0% (68/100) AND 62.0% (62/100) WERE OF POOR AND VERY POOR SCIENTIFIC QUALITY, RESPECTIVELY. ADDITIONALLY, 32.0% (32/100) OF THE VIDEOS WERE CLASSIFIED AS USEFUL, 48.0% (48/100) WERE CLASSIFIED AS MISLEADING, AND 34.0% (34/100) WERE CLASSIFIED AS POTENTIALLY HARMFUL. VIEWERS' RATINGS DID NOT CORRELATE WITH THE GQS AND DISCERN SCORES. OVERALL, 50.0% (50/100) OF THE VIDEOS WERE POSTED BY PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS AND PROMOTERS OF COMPLEMENTARY/ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS, 42.0% (42/100) BY THERAPEUTICAL ADVERTISERS, AND ONLY 8.0% (8/100) BY NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS/UNIVERSITIES. CONCLUSIONS: OUR STUDY DEMONSTRATED THAT TWO-THIRDS OF THE VIDEOS ANALYZED WERE BELOW ACCEPTABLE MEDICAL QUALITY STANDARDS AND THAT MANY VIDEOS WERE DISSEMINATING MISLEADING OR EVEN DANGEROUS CONTENT. SUBJECTIVE AND ANECDOTAL CONTENT WAS OVERREPRESENTED, AND VIEWERS DID NOT APPEAR TO BE ABLE TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN HIGH- AND LOW-QUALITY VIDEOS.

619,UNDERSTANDING HEALTH FOOD MESSAGES ON TWITTER FOR HEALTH LITERACY PROMOTION,"AIMS: WITH THE POPULARITY OF SOCIAL MEDIA, TWITTER HAS BECOME AN IMPORTANT TOOL TO PROMOTE HEALTH LITERACY. HOWEVER, MANY HEALTH-RELATED MESSAGES ON TWITTER ARE DEAD-ENDED AND CANNOT REACH MANY PEOPLE. THIS IS UNHELPFUL FOR HEALTH LITERACY PROMOTION. THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO EXAMINE THE FEATURES OF ONLINE HEALTH FOOD MESSAGES THAT PEOPLE LIKE TO RETWEET. METHODS: WE ADOPTED RUMOUR THEORY AS OUR THEORETICAL FOUNDATION AND EXTRACTED SEVEN CHARACTERISTICS (I.E. EMOTIONAL VALENCE, ATTRACTIVENESS, SENDER'S AUTHORITATIVENESS, EXTERNAL EVIDENCE, ARGUMENT LENGTH, HASHTAGS, AND DIRECT MESSAGES). A TOTAL OF 10,025 HEALTH-RELATED MESSAGES ON TWITTER WERE COLLECTED, AND 1496 MESSAGES WERE RANDOMLY SELECTED FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS. EACH MESSAGE WAS TREATED AS ONE UNIT AND THEN CODED. ALL THE HYPOTHESES WERE TESTED WITH LOGISTIC REGRESSION. RESULTS: EMOTIONAL VALENCE, ATTRACTIVENESS, SENDER'S AUTHORITATIVENESS, ARGUMENT LENGTH, AND DIRECT MESSAGES IN A TWITTER MESSAGE HAD POSITIVE EFFECTS ON PEOPLE'S RETWEET BEHAVIOUR. THE EFFECT OF EXTERNAL EVIDENCE WAS NEGATIVE. HASHTAGS HAD NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT AFTER CONSIDERATION OF OTHER VARIABLES. CONCLUSION: ONLINE HEALTH FOOD MESSAGES CONTAINING POSITIVE EMOTIONS, INCLUDING PICTURES, CONTAINING DIRECT MESSAGES, HAVING AN AUTHORITATIVE SENDER, HAVING LONGER ARGUMENTS, OR NOT CONTAINING EXTERNAL URLS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE RETWEETED. HOWEVER, A MESSAGE ONLY CONTAINING POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE EMOTIONS OR INCLUDING DIRECT MESSAGES WITHOUT ANY SUPPORT INFORMATION WILL NOT BE RETWEETED.",ONLINE HEALTH-RELATED MESSAGE; TWITTER; HEALTH LITERACY; RUMOUR THEORY,SOCIAL MEDIA; INTERNET; ONLINE; INFORMATION; RUMOR; CARE; PROFESSIONALS; BEHAVIOR; SEEKING; SITES,2018,https://doi.org/10.1177/1757913918760359,6,NA,0,0,0,AUSTRALIA,PERSPECTIVES IN PUBLIC HEALTH

137,IS CITIZEN JOURNALISM BETTER THAN PROFESSIONAL JOURNALISM FOR FACTCHECKING RUMOURS IN CHINA HOW WEIBO USERS VERIFIED INFORMATION FOLLOWING THE 2015 TIANJIN BLASTS,"THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES HOW CITIZENS CONTRIBUTE TO RUMOUR VERIFICATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA IN CHINA, DRAWING ON A CASE STUDY OF WEIBO COMMUNICATION ABOUT THE 2015 TIANJIN BLASTS. THREE ASPECTS OF CITIZEN ENGAGEMENT IN VERIFYING RUMOURS VIA WEIBO ARE EXAMINED: (1) HOW THEY DIRECTLY DEBUNKED RUMOURS RELATED TO THE BLASTS, (2) HOW THEY VERIFIED OFFICIAL RUMOUR MESSAGES AND (3) HOW THEY USED WEIBOÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S COMMUNITY VERIFICATION FUNCTION TO COLLECTIVELY IDENTIFY AND FACT-CHECK RUMOURS. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT IN CARRYING OUT SUCH ACTIVITIES, ORDINARY WEIBO USERS WERE ENGAGING IN PRACTICES OF CITIZEN JOURNALISM. FINDINGS FROM OUR ANALYSIS SUGGEST THAT EVEN THOUGH CITIZEN JOURNALISTSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ DIRECT ENGAGEMENT IN PUBLISHING DEBUNKING MESSAGES WAS NOT AS VISIBLE AS THAT OF THE POLICE AND MAINSTREAM MEDIA, SELF-ORGANISED GRASSROOTS RUMOUR-DEBUNKING PRACTICES DEMONSTRATE GREAT POTENTIAL. IN TERMS OF BOTH THE REPOSTS AND THE POSITIVE COMMENTS THEY RECEIVED, RUMOUR-DEBUNKING POSTS FROM NON-OFFICIAL ACTORS APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN GIVEN MORE CREDIBILITY THAN THOSE FROM THEIR OFFICIAL COUNTERPARTS. IN CONTRAST, THE OFFICIAL NARRATIVES ABOUT THE TIANJIN BLASTS WERE CHALLENGED, AND THE CREDIBILITY OF THE OFFICIAL RUMOUR-DEBUNKING MESSAGES WAS COMMONLY QUESTIONED. NEVERTHELESS, THIS ARTICLE ALSO SHOWS THAT WEIBOÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S COMMUNITY VERIFICATION SYSTEM HAD LIMITED EFFECTS IN FACILITATING HOW WEIBO USERS COULD COLLABORATIVELY FACT-CHECK POTENTIALLY FALSE INFORMATION.

NEVERTHELESS, THERE HASN'T BEEN MUCH INFORMATION ON HOW INDIVIDUALS PERCEIVE WFM IS AFFECTING THEIR DAILY WORK ROUTINE IN THE PANDEMIC. BY APPLYING THE STRESSORS-STRAIN-OUTCOME (SSO) FRAMEWORK, THE CURRENT STUDY DEVELOPS AND TESTS A MODEL THAT EXPLAINS HOW MISINFORMATION AND COVID-19 THREAT TRIGGERED THE ANXIETY AND SOCIAL MEDIA FATIGUE OF WFH EMPLOYEES AND AFFECTED THEIR WORK-RELATED RESPONSE. THIS STUDY COLLECTED DIARY DATA FOR TEN CONSECUTIVE DAYS FROM 56 WFH EMPLOYEES. RESULTS WIDELY SUPPORTED THE HYPOTHESIZED MODEL. SPECIFICALLY, FINDINGS REVEALED THAT MISINFORMATION AND COVID-19 THREAT INCREASE ANXIETY AND SOCIAL MEDIA FATIGUE AMONG THESE EMPLOYEES, RESULTING IN A LOWER LEVEL OF WORK ENGAGEMENT.

298,COVID19 MISINFORMATION ACCURACY OF ARTICLES ABOUT CORONAVIRUS PREVENTION MOSTLY SHARED ON SOCIAL MEDIA,"OBJECTIVE: TO ANALYZE ACCURACY OF ARTICLES ABOUT COVID-19 PREVENTION MOST FREQUENTLY SHARED THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS. METHODS: IDENTIFYING, USING THE BUZZSUMO ANALYTIC TOOL, 30 MOST FREQUENTLY SHARED ARTICLES IN APRIL 2020 ABOUT COVID-19 PREVENTION AND CLASSIFYING THEM ACCORDING TO NUMBER OF SHARES, ACCURACY, TOPIC AND SHARING PLATFORM. CALCULATIONS WERE MADE USING DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS TOOLS AND CHI-SQUARE TEST. RESULTS: THE TOP 30 ARTICLES ABOUT CORONAVIRUS PREVENTION WERE SHARED 4904 160 TIMES OVER A PERIOD OF ONE MONTH WITH 96.8% OF ALL SHARES THROUGH FACEBOOK. MOST OF THE ARTICLES (80%) WAS FOUND TO BE ACCURATE, HOWEVER THEY ACCOUNTED FOR ONLY 64% OF SHARES. THE INACCURACIES REFERRED MOSTLY TO HANDWASHING. THE MOST SHARED ARTICLES WERE ABOUT MEDICATIONS FOLLOWED BY MASKS AND HAND WASHING. CONCLUSIONS: ARTICLES ABOUT CORONAVIRUS PREVENTION ARE USUALLY ACCURATE, YET RELATIVELY LESS LIKELY TO BE SHARED THAN INACCURATE ONES. FACEBOOK REMAINS A DOMINANT SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM FOR SHARING CONTENT. BUZZSUMO COULD BE CONSIDERED A TOOL IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS SUCH AS PANDEMIC FOR HEALTH AUTHORITIES TO QUICKLY INVESTIGATE DIFFERENT HEALTH TOPICS POPULAR ON SOCIAL MEDIA. LAY SUMMARY: MOST OF THE ARTICLES ABOUT COVID-19 PREVENTION, IDENTIFIED AS MOST FREQUENTLY SHARED THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM DURING THE PANDEMIC, WAS FOUND TO BE ACCURATE. HOWEVER, INACCURATE CONTENT WAS MORE LIKELY TO BE SHARED THAN BY FACEBOOK USERS COMPARED WITH ACCURATE CONTENT. THIS SUGGESTS THE NEED FOR HEALTH AUTHORITIES TO MONITOR CONTENT SHARED ON SOCIAL MEDIA IN EXTRAORDINARY SITUATIONS SUCH AS PANDEMICS.

IN ONE EFFORT, THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION (WHO) DESIGNED AND PUBLICIZED SHAREABLE INFOGRAPHICS TO DEBUNK CORONAVIRUS MYTHS. WE USED AN EXPERIMENT TO TEST THE EFFICACY OF THESE INFOGRAPHICS, DEPENDING ON PLACEMENT AND SOURCE. WE FOUND THAT EXPOSURE TO A CORRECTIVE GRAPHIC ON SOCIAL MEDIA REDUCED MISPERCEPTIONS ABOUT THE SCIENCE OF 1 FALSE COVID-19 PREVENTION STRATEGY BUT DID NOT AFFECT MISPERCEPTIONS ABOUT PREVENTION OF COVID-19. LOWERED MISPERCEPTIONS ABOUT THE SCIENCE PERSISTED =1 WEEK LATER.

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: THE AUTHORS CONDUCTED AN ONLINE SURVEY AMONG 1,793 ADULTS IN THE USA IN EARLY APRIL. ALL PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY ENROLLED IN THIS RESEARCH THROUGH A PROFESSIONAL SURVEY COMPANY. THE STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING VIA AMOS 20 WAS ADOPTED FOR HYPOTHESIS TESTING. FINDINGS: RESULTS INDICATED THAT INDIVIDUALS ALSO PERCEIVED THAT OTHERS WERE MORE INFLUENCED BY MISINFORMATION ABOUT COVID-19 THAN THEY WERE. FURTHER, SUCH A PERCEPTUAL GAP WAS ASSOCIATED WITH PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR GOVERNMENTAL RESTRICTIONS AND CORRECTIVE ACTION. NEGATIVE AFFECTIONS TOWARD HEALTH MISINFORMATION DIRECTLY AFFECTED PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR GOVERNMENTAL RESTRICTIONS RATHER THAN CORRECTIVE ACTION. SUPPORT FOR GOVERNMENTAL RESTRICTIONS COULD FURTHER FACILITATE CORRECTIVE ACTION. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: THIS STUDY EXAMINED THE APPLICABILITY OF TPE THEORY IN THE CONTEXT OF DIGITAL HEALTH MISINFORMATION DURING A UNIQUE GLOBAL CRISIS.

523,APPEALING TO SENSE AND SENSIBILITY SYSTEM 1 AND SYSTEM 2 INTERVENTIONS FOR FAKE NEWS ON SOCIAL MEDIA,"DISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA-COMMONLY CALLED ""FAKE NEWS""-HAS BECOME A MAJOR CONCERN AROUND THE WORLD, AND MANY FACT-CHECKING INITIATIVES HAVE BEEN LAUNCHED TO MITIGATE THE PROBLEM. THE WAY FACT-CHECKING RESULTS ARE PRESENTED TO SOCIAL MEDIA USERS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF THE PRESENTATION FORMAT IS NOT PERSUASIVE, THEN FACT-CHECKING MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE. FOR INSTANCE, FACEBOOK TESTED THE IDEA OF FLAGGING DUBIOUS ARTICLES IN 2017 BUT CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS INEFFECTIVE AND SUBSEQUENTLY REMOVED THE FEATURE. WE CONDUCTED THREE EXPERIMENTS WITH SOCIAL MEDIA USERS TO INVESTIGATE TWO DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO IMPLEMENTING A FAKE NEWS FLAG-ONE DESIGNED TO HAVE ITS PRIMARY EFFECTWHEN PROCESSED BY AUTOMATIC COGNITION (SYSTEM 1) AND THE OTHER DESIGNED TO HAVE ITS PRIMARY EFFECT WHEN PROCESSED BY DELIBERATE COGNITION (SYSTEM 2).WE FOUND THAT BOTH INTERVENTIONS WERE EFFECTIVE, AND AN INTERVENTION THAT COMBINED BOTH APPROACHES WAS ABOUT TWICE AS EFFECTIVE.WE ALSO FOUND THAT AWARENESS TRAINING ON THE MEANING OF THE FLAGS INCREASED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE SYSTEM 2 INTERVENTION BUT NOT THE SYSTEM 1 INTERVENTION, EXACTLY AS THEORY PREDICTS.

IN THIS STUDY WE EXAMINED THE COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE RESPONSES THAT POLITICAL DISINFORMATION PROMPTED IN FACEBOOK, AS THE MOST POPULAR SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM. THROUGH TEXT ANALYSIS OF USER COMMENTS CORPORA ON NEARLY 2,100 POLITICAL POSTS FROM POPULAR SOURCES IN FACEBOOK, WE FOUND THAT COMPARED TO TRUE NEWS, POLITICAL DISINFORMATION RECEIVED SIGNIFICANTLY LESS ANALYTIC RESPONSES FROM FACEBOOK FOLLOWERS. WHILE THE RESULTS INDICATED GREATER ANXIETY IN RESPONSES TO TRUE NEWS, RESPONSES TO POLITICAL DISINFORMATION WERE FILLED WITH GREATER ANGER AND INCIVILITY. WE ALSO FOUND SIMILAR (LOW) LEVELS OF COGNITIVE THINKING IN RESPONSES TO EXTREME CONSERVATIVE AND EXTREME LIBERAL DISINFORMATION. CONTRARY TO PRIOR RESEARCH FINDINGS, OUR RESULTS INDICATED THAT RESPONSES TO EXTREME LIBERAL DISINFORMATION IN FACEBOOK WERE FILLED WITH GREATER ANGER AND INCIVILITY. THIS SUGGESTS THAT THE INCIVILITY AND OUTRAGE IN ONLINE POLITICAL DISCOURSES SHOULD NOT BE ATTRIBUTED TO A SPECIFIC POLITICAL PARTY WITHOUT CONSIDERING THE CONCURRENT POLITICAL EVENTS.

MORE SPECIFICALLY, (RIGHT-WING) POPULISTS ARE NOT ONLY ATTRIBUTING BLAME TO THE POLITICAL ELITES, BUT INCREASINGLY VENT ANTI-MEDIA SENTIMENTS IN WHICH THE MAINSTREAM PRESS IS SCAPEGOATED FOR NOT REPRESENTING THE PEOPLE. IN AN ERA OF POST-TRUTH RELATIVISM, 'FAKE NEWS' IS INCREASINGLY POLITICIZED AND USED AS A LABEL TO DELEGITIMIZE POLITICAL OPPONENTS OR THE PRESS. TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE AFFINITY BETWEEN DISINFORMATION AND POPULISM, THIS ARTICLE CONCEPTUALIZES TWO RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THESE CONCEPTS: (1) BLAME ATTRIBUTIONS TO THE DISHONEST MEDIA AS PART OF THE CORRUPT ELITES THAT MISLEAD THE PEOPLE; AND (2) THE EXPRESSION OF POPULIST BOUNDARIES IN A PEOPLE-CENTRIC, ANTI-EXPERT, AND EVIDENCE-FREE WAY. THE RESULTS OF A COMPARATIVE QUALITATIVE CONTENT ANALYSIS IN THE US AND NETHERLANDS INDICATE THAT THE POLITICAL LEADERS DONALD TRUMP AND GEERT WILDERS BLAME LEGACY MEDIA IN POPULIST WAYS BY REGARDING THEM AS PART OF THE CORRUPT AND LYING ESTABLISHMENT.

WITHOUT EFFECTIVE MEDICATIONS OR VACCINES AVAILABLE, AUTHORITIES TURNED TOWARD MITIGATION MEASURES SUCH AS USE OF FACE MASKS, SCHOOL'S CLOSINGS, SHELTER-IN-PLACE, TELEWORK AND SOCIAL DISTANCING. PEOPLE FOUND REFUGE ON THE INTERNET AND SOCIAL MEDIA APPS; HOWEVER, THERE WAS A PROLIFERATION OF INSTANT MESSAGING CONTAINING HOAXED, DELIBERATE MISLEADING INFORMATION: FAKE NEWS MESSAGING (FNM). THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS FNM THROUGH CONTENT ANALYSIS AND TO DISCRIMINATE THEM IN A PROPOSED TAXONOMY STRUCTURE. A SAMPLE OF CONVENIENCE OF MESSAGES, MEMES, TWEETS OR CARTOONS IN SEVERAL LANGUAGES WAS SELECTED FROM THE MOST POPULAR SOCIAL MEDIA OUTLETS, I.E. FACEBOOK, WHATSAPP, TWITTER ETC. MORE THAN 300 FNM WERE IDENTIFIED. DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS WERE USED FOR HIGHLIGHTING POTENTIAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN VARIABLES. CONTENT ANALYSIS DETERMINED THAT FNM COULD BE DIVIDED INTO HEALTH- AND NON-HEALTH-RELATED TYPES. THERE ARE SEVERAL SUB-TYPES CONSIDERING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, RELIGIOUS BELIEFS, POLITICS, ECONOMY, NUTRITION, BEHAVIORS, PREVENTION OF THE INFECTION, THE ORIGIN OF THE DISEASE AND CONSPIRACY THEORIES. THE PARALLEL FNM PANDEMIC AFFECTED THE RESPONSE FROM AN ALREADY DEBILITATED PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM THROUGH THE CONFUSION CREATED IN THE COMMUNITY AND THE EROSION IN THE CREDIBILITY OF GENUINE MEDIA.

YET, RESEARCH ON THE PSYCHOLOGICAL MOTIVATIONS BEHIND THE SPREAD OF POLITICAL FAKE NEWS ON SOCIAL MEDIA IS SURPRISINGLY LIMITED. ARE CITIZENS WHO SHARE FAKE NEWS IGNORANT AND LAZY? ARE THEY FUELED BY SINISTER MOTIVES, SEEKING TO DISRUPT THE SOCIAL STATUS QUO? OR DO THEY SEEK TO ATTACK PARTISAN OPPONENTS IN AN INCREASINGLY POLARIZED POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT? THIS ARTICLE IS THE FIRST TO TEST THESE COMPETING HYPOTHESES BASED ON A CAREFUL MAPPING OF PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILES OF OVER 2,300 AMERICAN TWITTER USERS LINKED TO BEHAVIORAL SHARING DATA AND SENTIMENT ANALYSES OF MORE THAN 500,000 NEWS STORY HEADLINES. THE FINDINGS CONTRADICT THE IGNORANCE PERSPECTIVE BUT PROVIDE SOME SUPPORT FOR THE DISRUPTION PERSPECTIVE AND STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE PARTISAN POLARIZATION PERSPECTIVE. THUS, INDIVIDUALS WHO REPORT HATING THEIR POLITICAL OPPONENTS ARE THE MOST LIKELY TO SHARE POLITICAL FAKE NEWS AND SELECTIVELY SHARE CONTENT THAT IS USEFUL FOR DEROGATING THESE OPPONENTS.

280,EFFECTS OF FACTCHECKING SOCIAL MEDIA VACCINE MISINFORMATION ON ATTITUDES TOWARD VACCINES,"SOCIAL MEDIA VACCINE MISINFORMATION CAN NEGATIVELY INFLUENCE VACCINE ATTITUDES. IT IS URGENT TO DEVELOP COMMUNICATION APPROACHES TO REDUCE THE MISINFORMATION'S IMPACT. THIS STUDY AIMED TO TEST THE EFFECTS OF FACT-CHECKING LABELS FOR MISINFORMATION ON ATTITUDES TOWARD VACCINES. AN ONLINE SURVEY EXPERIMENT WITH 1198 PARTICIPANTS RECRUITED FROM A U.S. NATIONAL SAMPLE WAS CONDUCTED IN 2018. PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO SIX CONDITIONS: MISINFORMATION CONTROL, OR FACT-CHECKING LABEL CONDITIONS ATTRIBUTED TO ALGORITHMS, NEWS MEDIA, HEALTH INSTITUTIONS, RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES, OR FACT-CHECKING ORGANIZATIONS. WE ANALYZED DIFFERENCES IN VACCINE ATTITUDES BETWEEN THE FACT-CHECKING LABEL AND CONTROL CONDITIONS. FURTHER, WE COMPARED PERCEIVED EXPERTISE AND TRUSTWORTHINESS OF THE FIVE CATEGORIES OF FACT-CHECKING SOURCES. FACT-CHECKING LABELS ATTACHED TO MISINFORMATION POSTS MADE VACCINE ATTITUDES MORE POSITIVE COMPARED TO THE MISINFORMATION CONTROL CONDITION (P = .003, COHEN'S D= 0.21). CONSPIRACY IDEATION MODERATED THE EFFECT OF THE LABELS ON VACCINE ATTITUDES (P = .02). UNIVERSITIES AND HEALTH INSTITUTIONS WERE RATED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER ON SOURCE EXPERTISE THAN OTHER SOURCES. MEDIATION ANALYSES SHOWED LABELS ATTRIBUTED TO UNIVERSITIES AND HEALTH INSTITUTIONS INDIRECTLY RESULTED IN MORE POSITIVE ATTITUDES THAN OTHER SOURCES THROUGH PERCEIVED EXPERTISE. EXPOSURE TO FACT-CHECKING LABELS ON MISINFORMATION CAN GENERATE MORE POSITIVE ATTITUDES TOWARD VACCINES IN COMPARISON TO EXPOSURE TO MISINFORMATION. INCORPORATING LABELS FROM TRUSTED UNIVERSITIES AND HEALTH INSTITUTIONS ON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS IS A PROMISING DIRECTION FOR ADDRESSING THE VACCINE MISINFORMATION PROBLEM. THIS POINTS TO THE NECESSITY FOR CLOSER COLLABORATION BETWEEN PUBLIC HEALTH AND RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS AND SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES TO JOIN EFFORTS IN ADDRESSING THE CURRENT MISINFORMATION THREAT.

250,CHARACTERIZING THE DISSEMINATION OF MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA IN HEALTH EMERGENCIES AN EMPIRICAL STUDY BASED ON COVID19,"THE DISSEMINATION OF MISINFORMATION IN HEALTH EMERGENCIES POSES SERIOUS THREATS TO PUBLIC HEALTH AND INCREASES HEALTH ANXIETY. TO UNDERSTAND THE UNDERLYING MECHANISM OF THE DISSEMINATION OF MISINFORMATION REGARDING HEALTH EMERGENCIES, THIS STUDY CREATIVELY DRAWS ON SOCIAL SUPPORT THEORY AND TEXT MINING. IT ALSO EXPLORES THE ROLES OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF MISINFORMATION, INCLUDING HEALTH ADVICE AND CAUTION MISINFORMATION AND HEALTH HELP-SEEKING MISINFORMATION, AND EMOTIONAL SUPPORT IN AFFECTING INDIVIDUALSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ MISINFORMATION DISSEMINATION BEHAVIOR ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND WHETHER SUCH RELATIONSHIPS ARE CONTINGENT ON MISINFORMATION AMBIGUITY AND RICHNESS. THE THEORETICAL MODEL IS TESTED USING 12,101 TEXTUAL DATA ABOUT COVID-19 COLLECTED FROM SINA WEIBO, A LEADING SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM IN CHINA. THE EMPIRICAL RESULTS SHOW THAT HEALTH CAUTION AND ADVICE, HELP SEEKING MISINFORMATION, AND EMOTIONAL SUPPORT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE DISSEMINATION OF MISINFORMATION. FURTHERMORE, WHEN THE LEVEL OF AMBIGUITY AND RICHNESS REGARDING MISINFORMATION IS HIGH, THE EFFECT OF HEALTH CAUTION AND ADVICE MISINFORMATION IS STRENGTHENED, WHEREAS THE EFFECT OF HEALTH HELP-SEEKING MISINFORMATION AND EMOTIONAL SUPPORT IS WEAKENED, INDICATING BOTH DARK AND BRIGHT MISINFORMATION AMBIGUITY AND RICHNESS.

297,RECIPROCAL SPREADING AND DEBUNKING PROCESSES OF ONLINE MISINFORMATION A NEW RUMOR SPREADINGDEBUNKING MODEL WITH A CASE STUDY,"IN THIS DIGITAL ERA, MASSIVE DIGITAL MISINFORMATION WAS RANKED FIRST BY THE WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM AMONG THE TOP FUTURE GLOBAL RISKS. AS HUMAN AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES ARE LIMITED, GOVERNMENTS OR COMPANIES WOULD LIKE TO USE THE OPTIMAL LEVEL OF DEBUNKING EFFORT AND THE MOST EFFICIENT DEBUNKING STRATEGY. THERE EXISTS A RICH LITERATURE THAT STUDIES THE RUMOR SPREADING PROCESS ON SOCIAL MEDIA. HOWEVER, A HUGE GAP EXISTS ON STUDYING THE SIMULTANEOUS PROPAGATION OF FALSE RUMORS AND DEBUNKING INFORMATION, AND THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN THEM. THE SPREADING OF RUMORS AND ANTI-RUMORS IS A DYNAMIC AND RECIPROCAL PROCESS. ACKNOWLEDGING THAT EFFECTIVE DEBUNKING STRATEGY IS A POTENTIAL TOOL TO REDUCE THE LOSS OF MASSIVE DIGITAL MISINFORMATION, THIS PAPER PROPOSES A NOVEL RUMOR SPREADINGÃ¢â‚¬â€œDEBUNKING (RSD) MODEL BY ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION (ODE) SYSTEM TO EXPLORE THE INTERPLAY MECHANISM BETWEEN RUMOR SPREADING AND DEBUNKING PROCESSES. WE DERIVE AND DISCUSS THE KEY FACTORS AND PARAMETERS THAT INFLUENCE THE DEBUNKING PROCESS. FIRSTLY, WE CONSIDER THE SPREADING PATTERN OF A RUMOR BEFORE DEBUNKERS APPEAR BASED ON THE SUSCEPTIBLEÃ¢â‚¬â€œINFECTEDÃ¢â‚¬â€œRECOVERED (SIR) MODEL WITH ITS OWN CHARACTERISTICS OF RUMOR, AND OBTAIN A SERIES OF RESULTS INCLUDING THE FINAL SCOPE OF THE RUMOR SPREADING, THE MAXIMAL SCALE OF THE RUMOR SPREADER, THE NUMBER OF STIFLERS AT ANY TIME POINT, AND THE POPULARITY LEVEL OF THE RUMOR. SECONDLY, WITH THE DATA FROM THE REAL WORLD RUMOR CASE, WHICH IS THE Ã¢â‚¬ÂIMMIGRATION RUMORÃ¢â‚¬Â DURING HURRICANE HARVEY IN 2017, WE DETERMINE THE CASE-SPECIFIC PARAMETERS, AND VALIDATE OUR MODEL BY COMPARING THE SIMULATED CURVE WITH THE REAL DATA. OUR MODEL HELPS TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT OF THE RUMOR ON THE SOCIAL MEDIA, AND PREDICT THE FUTURE TREND. FINALLY, WE USE OUR MODEL TO SIMULATE THE INFLUENCE OF DIFFERENT DEBUNKING STRATEGY, AND IDENTIFY MORE EFFICIENT DEBUNKING MEASURES THAT SHOULD BE USED BY THE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS OR COMPANIES WHEN FACING RUMOR MILL UNDER DIFFERENT SITUATIONS.

HERE, WE ANALYZE THE PREVALENCE AND DIFFUSION OF LINKS TO LOW-CREDIBILITY CONTENT ABOUT THE PANDEMIC ACROSS TWO MAJOR SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS, TWITTER AND FACEBOOK. WE CHARACTERIZE CROSS-PLATFORM SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES IN POPULAR SOURCES, DIFFUSION PATTERNS, INFLUENCERS, COORDINATION, AND AUTOMATION. COMPARING THE TWO PLATFORMS, WE FIND DIVERGENCE AMONG THE PREVALENCE OF POPULAR LOW-CREDIBILITY SOURCES AND SUSPICIOUS VIDEOS. A MINORITY OF ACCOUNTS AND PAGES EXERT A STRONG INFLUENCE ON EACH PLATFORM. THESE MISINFORMATION Ã¢â‚¬Å“SUPERSPREADERSÃ¢â‚¬Â ARE OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH THE LOW-CREDIBILITY SOURCES AND TEND TO BE VERIFIED BY THE PLATFORMS. ON BOTH PLATFORMS, THERE IS EVIDENCE OF COORDINATED SHARING OF INFODEMIC CONTENT. THE OVERT NATURE OF THIS MANIPULATION POINTS TO THE NEED FOR SOCIETAL-LEVEL SOLUTIONS IN ADDITION TO MITIGATION STRATEGIES WITHIN THE PLATFORMS.

277,PUBLIC DISCOURSE AGAINST MASKS IN THE COVID19 ERA INFODEMIOLOGY STUDY OF TWITTER DATA,"BACKGROUND: DESPITE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE IMPORTANCE OF WEARING MASKS TO CURTAIL THE SPREAD OF COVID-19, WEARING MASKS HAS STIRRED UP A SIGNIFICANT DEBATE PARTICULARLY ON SOCIAL MEDIA. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY AIMED TO INVESTIGATE THE TOPICS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PUBLIC DISCOURSE AGAINST WEARING MASKS IN THE UNITED STATES. WE ALSO STUDIED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE ANTI-MASK DISCOURSE ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE NUMBER OF NEW COVID-19 CASES. METHODS: WE COLLECTED A TOTAL OF 51,170 ENGLISH TWEETS BETWEEN JANUARY 1, 2020, AND OCTOBER 27, 2020, BY SEARCHING FOR HASHTAGS AGAINST WEARING MASKS. WE USED MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES TO ANALYZE THE DATA COLLECTED. WE INVESTIGATED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE VOLUME OF TWEETS AGAINST MASK-WEARING AND THE DAILY VOLUME OF NEW COVID-19 CASES USING A PEARSON CORRELATION ANALYSIS BETWEEN THE TWO-TIME SERIES. RESULTS: THE RESULTS AND ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT SOCIAL MEDIA COULD HELP IDENTIFY IMPORTANT INSIGHTS RELATED TO WEARING MASKS. THE RESULTS OF TOPIC MINING IDENTIFIED 10 CATEGORIES OR THEMES OF USER CONCERNS DOMINATED BY (1) CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS AND FREEDOM OF CHOICE; (2) CONSPIRACY THEORY, POPULATION CONTROL, AND BIG PHARMA; AND (3) FAKE NEWS, FAKE NUMBERS, AND FAKE PANDEMIC. ALTOGETHER, THESE THREE CATEGORIES REPRESENT ALMOST 65% OF THE VOLUME OF TWEETS AGAINST WEARING MASKS. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE VOLUME OF TWEETS AGAINST WEARING MASKS AND NEWLY REPORTED COVID-19 CASES DEPICTED A STRONG CORRELATION WHEREIN THE RISE IN THE VOLUME OF NEGATIVE TWEETS LED THE RISE IN THE NUMBER OF NEW CASES BY 9 DAYS. CONCLUSIONS: THESE FINDINGS DEMONSTRATED THE POTENTIAL OF MINING SOCIAL MEDIA FOR UNDERSTANDING THE PUBLIC DISCOURSE ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES SUCH AS WEARING MASKS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. THE RESULTS EMPHASIZED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE DISCOURSE ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON REAL EVENTS SUCH AS CHANGING THE COURSE OF THE PANDEMIC.

HOWEVER, RESEARCH ON HOW THEY CORRECT HEALTH MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA IS RARE. OBJECTIVE: TO DEVELOP A CONCEPTUAL MODEL THAT DEMONSTRATES HOW HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS CORRECT HEALTH MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA. METHODS: IN-DEPTH SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED BETWEEN JANUARY AND MARCH 2020 WITH 30 U.S. HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS (15 REGISTERED NURSES AND 15 MEDICAL DOCTORS). PARTICIPANTS WERE RECRUITED THROUGH PURPOSIVE AND SNOWBALL SAMPLING AND INTERVIEWED VIA MOBILE PHONE CALLS (USING THEIR MOBILE PHONE NUMBER) OR APPS (VIA ZOOM OR SKYPE). INTERVIEW DATA WERE ANALYZED USING A GROUNDED THEORY APPROACH. RESULTS: THIS STUDY PRESENTS A TWO-PHASED CONCEPTUAL MODEL THAT SHOWS HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ ACTS OF CORRECTING HEALTH MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA (E.G., TWITTER AND FACEBOOK). THE FIRST PHASE INVOLVES ACTS OF AUTHENTICATION BY WHICH HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS VERIFY HEALTH-RELATED SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS TO BE TRUE OR NOT. THEY UNDERGO THE PROCESS OF INTERNAL ACTS OF AUTHENTICATION (I.E., CHECKING THE AUTHOR, CHECKING FOR CUES, CHECKING THE TOPIC) AND, IF NEEDED, EXTERNAL ACTS OF AUTHENTICATION (I.E., EXAMINING THE AUTHOR AND EXAMINING THE CONTENT). WHEN SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS ARE DEEMED TO CONTAIN HEALTH MISINFORMATION, THEY PROCEED TO THE SECOND PHASE Ã¢â‚¬â€œ ACTS OF CORRECTION. IN THIS PHASE, THEY UNDERGO CORRECTION PREPARATION (I.E., REFLECT, REVEAL, RELATE, AND RESPECT) AND CORRECTION DISSEMINATION (I.E., PRIVATE PRIMING, PUBLIC PRIMING, PUBLIC REBUTTAL, AND PRIVATE REBUTTAL). CONCLUSIONS: THE STUDY PROPOSED A CONCEPTUAL MODEL THAT SHOWS HOW HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS CORRECT HEALTH MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA. THE FINDINGS CAN GUIDE HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS WHEN IDENTIFYING AND CORRECTING HEALTH MISINFORMATION ON AND OFF SOCIAL MEDIA, AND CAN GUIDE HEALTH AUTHORITIES WHEN DEVELOPING CAMPAIGNS AGAINST HEALTH MISINFORMATION.

INJUNCTIVE SOCIAL NORMS DESCRIBE WHAT BEHAVIOR MOST PEOPLE APPROVE OR DISAPPROVE. DESCRIPTIVE SOCIAL NORMS REFER TO WHAT OTHER PEOPLE DO IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS. THE RESULTS REVEAL, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT HIGHLIGHTING THE SOCIALLY DESIRED BEHAVIOR OF REPORTING FAKE NEWS USING AN INJUNCTIVE SOCIAL NORM LEADS TO HIGHER REPORTING RATES FOR FAKE NEWS. IN CONTRAST, DESCRIPTIVE SOCIAL NORMS DO NOT HAVE SUCH AN EFFECT.

HOWEVER, SINCE THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW MEDIA LITERACY, NO STUDY TO DATE EXAMINED DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS, PERSONALITY FACTORS, AND SOCIAL NETWORK SITE (SNS) USE RELATED TO IT. MORE IMPORTANTLY, NO RESEARCH EXAMINED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NEW MEDIA LITERACY AND PERCEPTIONS AND ACTIONS RELATED TO CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES. THESE UNDER-EXPLORED FACETS DETER PRACTITIONERS FROM TAILORING FUTURE NEW MEDIA LITERACY CURRICULA AND IDENTIFYING THE TARGETED AUDIENCE. WITH A SURVEY OF 551 YOUNG ADULTS, OUR STUDY REVEALED THAT MEDIA LITERACY PRACTITIONERS SHOULD DEVOTE MORE ATTENTION TO (A) CAUCASIAN MALES WITH LOW SNS USE, (B) NON-CAUCASIAN FEMALES WITH LOW SNS USE, AND (C) INDIVIDUALS WITH LOW NEED FOR COGNITION AND SNS USE. OUR STUDY FURTHER SHOWED THAT INCREASING NEW MEDIA LITERACY CAN HELP REDUCE MISPERCEPTIONS INDUCED BY MISINFORMATION THAT IS RAMPANT IN THE NEW MEDIA ENVIRONMENT.

421,MODELLING THE ANTECEDENT FACTORS THAT AFFECT ONLINE FAKE NEWS SHARING ON COVID19 THE MODERATING ROLE OF FAKE NEWS KNOWLEDGE,"WE PROPOSED A CONCEPTUAL MODEL COMBINING THREE THEORIES: USES AND GRATIFICATION THEORY, SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES (SNS) DEPENDENCY THEORY AND SOCIAL IMPACT THEORY TO UNDERSTAND THE FACTORS THAT PREDICT FAKE NEWS SHARING RELATED TO COVID-19. WE ALSO TESTED THE MODERATING ROLE OF FAKE NEWS KNOWLEDGE IN REDUCING THE TENDENCY TO SHARE FAKE NEWS. DATA WERE DRAWN FROM SOCIAL MEDIA USERS (N Ã‚Â¼ 650) IN NIGERIA, AND PARTIAL LEAST SQUARES WAS USED TO ANALYSE THE DATA. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT TIE STRENGTH WAS THE STRONGEST PREDICTOR OF FAKE NEWS SHARING RELATED TO COVID-19 PANDEMIC. WE ALSO FOUND PERCEIVED HERD, SNS DEPENDENCY, INFORMATION-SEEKING AND PARASOCIAL INTERACTION TO BE SIGNIFICANT PREDICTORS OF FAKE NEWS SHARING. THE EFFECT OF STATUS-SEEKING ON FAKE NEWS SHARING, HOWEVER, WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT. OUR RESULTS ALSO ESTABLISHED THAT FAKE NEWS KNOWLEDGE SIGNIFICANTLY MODERATED THE EFFECT OF PERCEIVED HERD, SNS DEPENDENCY, INFORMATION-SEEKING, PARASOCIAL INTERACTION ON FAKE NEWS SHARING RELATED TO COVID-19.

249,INFORMATION OVERLOAD AND FAKE NEWS SHARING A TRANSACTIONAL STRESS PERSPECTIVE EXPLORING THE MITIGATING ROLE OF CONSUMERS RESILIENCE DURING COVID19,"THE SPREAD OF FAKE NEWS IN SOCIAL NETWORKS HAS BECOME A MAJOR CONCERN FOR VARIOUS SECTORS OF SOCIETY, INCLUDING RETAIL AND SERVICE PROVIDERS, SOME OF WHOM HAVE SUFFERED FROM DECREASING SALES DUE TO MISINFORMATION CONSUMERS SHARED ONLINE. THE CURRENT COVID-19 CRISIS HAS ADDED TO THE SURROUNDING HYSTERIA, AS FAKE NEWS DURING CRISES CAN HEIGHTEN NEGATIVE BEHAVIOURAL RESPONSES IN CONSUMERS, SUCH AS IRRATIONAL PANIC BUYING OR TAKING FALSE MEDICAL PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES. IN FACT, DRIVEN BY THE UBIQUITOUS SOCIAL MEDIA LANDSCAPE, THE DISSEMINATION OF MISINFORMATION AND THE OVERARCHING OVERABUNDANCE OF INFORMATION HAVE BEEN MAJOR CHALLENGES OF THE PANDEMIC. GIVEN THAT CURRENT RESEARCH OFFERS LITTLE INSIGHT INTO THE PROCESSES BEHIND THE SHARING OF FAKE NEWS AMONG CONSUMERS AND THAT RESEARCH ON CONSUMER-CENTRED MITIGATING MECHANISMS IS MISSING, THIS STUDY EXPLORES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INFORMATION OVERLOAD, FAKE NEWS SHARING, AND THE OVERLOOKED CONCEPT OF CONSUMERS' RESILIENCE AS A POTENTIAL SHIELD AS VIEWED THROUGH THE LENS OF THE CURRENT CRISIS. STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELLING IS APPLIED TO CROSS-SECTIONAL DATA FROM 241 SOCIAL MEDIA USERS. DRAWING FROM THEORIES OF TRANSACTIONAL STRESS AND PSYCHOLOGICAL RESILIENCE, IT IS DEMONSTRATED THAT INFORMATION OVERLOAD LEADS TO AN INCREASED LIKELIHOOD OF FAKE NEWS SHARING BY INCREASING CONSUMERS' PSYCHOLOGICAL STRAIN. FURTHERMORE, THE STUDY SHOWS THAT CONSUMERS' RESILIENCE HAS THE POWER TO MITIGATE THE DRASTIC EFFECTS OF THIS NEGATIVE CHAIN OF INFLUENCE BY INHIBITING EACH OF THE PROCESSUAL COMPONENTS. THE RESULTS HAVE IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS EXTENDING BEYOND CRISES. MEASURES SHOULD BE TAKEN TO ENHANCE CONSUMERSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ RESILIENCE AMIDST TECHNOLOGY-INDUCED STRESSORS WHILE ALTERING THE INFORMATION ENVIRONMENT CONFRONTING CONSUMERS.

258,MITIGATING INFODEMICS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NEWS EXPOSURE AND TRUST AND BELIEF IN COVID19 FAKE NEWS AND SOCIAL MEDIA SPREADING,"INTRODUCTION MISINFORMATION SURROUNDING COVID-19 POSES A GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM THAT ADVERSELY AFFECTS GOVERNMENTS' ABILITIES TO MITIGATE THE DISEASE AND CAUSES ACCIDENTAL DEATHS AND SELFHARM DUE TO FALSE BELIEFS ABOUT THE VIRUS, PREVENTION MEASURES, VACCINES AND CURES. WE AIM TO EXAMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EXPOSURE TO AND TRUST IN COVID-19 NEWS (FROM TELEVISION, SOCIAL MEDIA, INTERPERSONAL COMMUNICATION) AND INFORMATION SOURCES (HEALTHCARE EXPERTS, GOVERNMENT, CLERICS) AND BELIEF IN COVID-19 MYTHS AND FALSE INFORMATION, AS WELL AS CRITICAL VERIFICATION PRACTICES BEFORE POSTING ON SOCIAL MEDIA. METHODS WE USE A CROSS-SECTIONAL RESEARCHER-ADMINISTERED PHONE SURVEY OF ADULTS LIVING IN LEBANON BETWEEN MARCH 27 AND APRIL 23, 2020. RESULTS THE SAMPLE INCLUDED 56.1% MEN AND 43.9% WOMEN, 37.9% WITH A UNIVERSITY DEGREE, 63.0% OLDER THAN 30, AND 7% WITH MEDIA LITERACY TRAINING. THOSE WHO TRUST COVID-19 NEWS FROM SOCIAL MEDIA [95%CI:(1.05-1.52)] AND INTERPERSONAL COMMUNICATION [95%CI:(1.25-1.82)], AND THOSE WHO TRUST INFORMATION FROM CLERICS [95%CI:(1.25-1.82)] WERE MORE LIKELY TO BELIEVE IN COVID-19 MYTHS AND FALSE INFORMATION. UNIVERSITY GRADUATES [95%CI:(0.25-0.51)] AND THOSE WHO TRUST INFORMATION FROM GOVERNMENT [95%CI:(0.65-0.89] WERE LESS LIKELY TO BELIEVE IN MYTHS AND FALSE INFORMATION. THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN COVID-19 MYTHS AND FALSE INFORMATION [95%CI:(0.25-0.70)] WERE LESS LIKELY TO ENGAGE IN CRITICAL SOCIAL MEDIA POSTING PRACTICES. ONLY THOSE WHO UNDERWENT MEDIA LITERACY TRAINING [95%CI:(1.24-6.55)] WERE MORE LIKELY TO ENGAGE IN CRITICAL SOCIAL MEDIA POSTING PRACTICES. CONCLUSION HIGHER EDUCATION AND TRUST IN INFORMATION FROM GOVERNMENT CONTRIBUTED TO DECREASING BELIEF IN COVID-19 MYTHS AND FALSE INFORMATION. TRUST IN NEWS FROM SOCIAL MEDIA, INTERPERSONAL COMMUNICATION AND CLERICS CONTRIBUTED TO INCREASING BELIEF IN COVID-19 MYTHS AND FALSE INFORMATION, WHICH IN TURN CONTRIBUTED TO LESS CRITICAL SOCIAL MEDIA POSTING PRACTICES, THEREBY EXACERBATED THE INFODEMIC. MEDIA LITERACY TRAINING CONTRIBUTED TO INCREASING CRITICAL SOCIAL MEDIA POSTING PRACTICES, THEREBY PLAYED A ROLE IN MITIGATING THE INFODEMIC. COPYRIGHT: Ã‚Â© 2021 MELKI ET AL.

287,WHO IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO ONLINE HEALTH MISINFORMATION A TEST OF FOUR PSYCHOSOCIAL HYPOTHESES,"OBJECTIVE: HEALTH MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA THREATENS PUBLIC HEALTH. ONE QUESTION THAT COULD LEND INSIGHT INTO HOW AND THROUGH WHOM MISINFORMATION SPREADS IS WHETHER CERTAIN PEOPLE ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO MANY TYPES OF HEALTH MISINFORMATION, REGARDLESS OF THE HEALTH TOPIC AT HAND. THIS STUDY PROVIDED AN INITIAL ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION AND ALSO TESTED FOUR HYPOTHESES CONCERNING THE PSYCHOSOCIAL ATTRIBUTES OF PEOPLE WHO ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO HEALTH MISINFORMATION: (1) DEFICITS IN KNOWLEDGE OR SKILL, (2) PREEXISTING ATTITUDES, (3) TRUST IN HEALTH CARE AND/OR SCIENCE, AND (4) COGNITIVE MISERLINESS. METHOD: PARTICIPANTS IN A NATIONAL U.S. SURVEY (N = 923) RATED THE PERCEIVED ACCURACY AND INFLUENCE OF TRUE AND FALSE SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS ABOUT STATIN MEDICATIONS, CANCER TREATMENT, AND THE HUMAN PAPILLOMA VIRUS (HPV) VACCINE AND THEN RESPONDED TO INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCE AND DEMOGRAPHIC QUESTIONS. RESULTS: PERCEIVED ACCURACY OF HEALTH MISINFORMATION WAS STRONGLY CORRELATED ACROSS STATINS, CANCER, AND THE HPV VACCINE (RS = .70), INDICATING THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO MISINFORMATION ABOUT ONE OF THESE TOPICS ARE VERY LIKELY TO BELIEVE MISINFORMATION ABOUT THE OTHER TOPICS AS WELL. MISINFORMATION SUSCEPTIBILITY ACROSS ALL THREE TOPICS WAS MOST STRONGLY PREDICTED BY LOWER EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT AND HEALTH LITERACY, DISTRUST IN THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, AND POSITIVE ATTITUDES TOWARD ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE. CONCLUSIONS: A PERSON WHO IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO ONLINE MISINFORMATION ABOUT ONE HEALTH TOPIC MAY BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO MANY TYPES OF HEALTH MISINFORMATION. INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO HEALTH MISINFORMATION HAD LESS EDUCATION AND HEALTH LITERACY, LESS HEALTH CARE TRUST, AND MORE POSITIVE ATTITUDES TOWARD ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE.

THIS COMMENTARY SEEKS TO ALERT AND ENCOURAGE THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDER COMMUNITY, INCLUDING HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS AND ACADEMIC ORGANIZATIONS, TO ENGAGE IN SOCIAL MEDIA TO COUNTER THE MOUNTING VACCINE-RELATED INFODEMIC. TO VALIDATE OUR RECOMMENDATION FOR ENGAGEMENT, THE AUTHORS DESCRIBE PRELIMINARY FINDINGS USING A MIXED METHODS APPROACH OF QUANTITATIVE TWITTER-BASED RANKING ALGORITHMS OF NETWORKS AND USERS WITH QUALITATIVE CONTENT ANALYSIS OF 1 MILLION TWEETS RELATED TO COVID-19 VACCINE CONVERSATIONS. RESULTS SHOW HIGHLY POLARIZED AND ACTIVE ANTIVACCINE CONVERSATIONS THAT WERE PRIMARILY INFLUENCED BY POLITICAL AND NONMEDICAL TWITTER USERS. IN CONTRAST, LESS THAN 10% OF THE TWEETS STEMMED FROM THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY, DEMONSTRATING A LACK OF ACTIVE HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL CONNECTIVITY IN ADDRESSING COVID-19 MISINFORMATION. THE AUTHORS INTRODUCE THE CONCEPT OF HEALTH CARE PROVIDER SOCIAL MEDIA HESITANCY TO REFER TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH THREAT OF HEALTH CARE PROVIDERSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ NONACTION IN PROVIDING PRO-VACCINE AND SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION ABOUT THE VACCINE ON SOCIAL MEDIA.

414,VACCINE MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIATOPICBASED CONTENT AND SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF POLISH VACCINEDENIERS COMMENTS ON FACEBOOK,"INTRODUCTION: VACCINATIONS ARE REFERRED TO AS ONE OF THE GREATEST ACHIEVEMENTS OF MODERN MEDICINE. HOWEVER, THEIR EFFECTIVENESS IS ALSO CONSTANTLY DENIED BY CERTAIN GROUPS IN SOCIETY. THIS RESULTS IN AN ONGOING DISPUTE THAT HAS BEEN GRADUALLY MOVING ONLINE IN THE LAST FEW YEARS DUE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF TECHNOLOGY. OUR STUDY AIMED TO UTILIZE SOCIAL MEDIA TO IDENTIFY AND ANALYZE VACCINE-DENIERSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ ARGUMENTS AGAINST CHILD VACCINATIONS. METHOD: ALL PUBLIC COMMENTS POSTED TO A LEADING POLISH VACCINATION OPPONENTSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ FACEBOOK PAGE POSTED BETWEEN 01/05/2019 AND 31/07/2019 WERE COLLECTED AND ANALYZED QUANTITATIVELY IN TERMS OF THEIR CONTENT ACCORDING TO THE MODIFIED METHOD DEVELOPED BY KATA (KATA, 2010). SENTIMENT ANALYSIS WAS ALSO PERFORMED. RESULTS: OUT OF 18,685 COMMENTS ANALYZED, 4,042 CONTAINED CONTENT COVERED BY THE ADOPTED CRITERIA: CONSPIRACY THEORIES (28.2%), MISINFORMATION AND UNRELIABLE PREMISES (19.9%), CONTENT RELATED TO THE SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF VACCINATIONS (14.0%), NONCOMPLIANCE WITH CIVIL RIGHTS (13.2%), OWN EXPERIENCE (https://doi.org/10.9%), MORALITY, RELIGION, AND BELIEF (8.5%), AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE (5.4%). THERE WERE ALSO 1,223 PRO-VACCINE COMMENTS, OF WHICH 15.2% WERE OFFENSIVE, MOCKING, OR NON-SUBSTANTIVE. SENTIMENT ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT COMMENTS WITHOUT ANY ARGUMENTS AS WELL AS THOSE CONTAINING STATEMENTS ABOUT ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE OR MISINFORMATION WERE MORE POSITIVE AND LESS ANGRY THAN COMMENTS IN OTHER TOPIC CATEGORIES. CONCLUSIONS: THE LARGE AMOUNT OF CONTENT IN THE CONSPIRACY THEORY AND MISINFORMATION CATEGORIES MAY INDICATE THAT AUTHORS OF SUCH COMMENTS MAY BE CHARACTERIZED BY A LACK OF TRUST IN THE SCIENTIFIC ACHIEVEMENTS OF MEDICINE. THESE FINDINGS SHOULD BE ADEQUATELY ADDRESSED IN VACCINATION CAMPAIGNS. Ã‚Â© 2021 THE AUTHOR(S).

SECOND, WE INVESTIGATE THE INFLUENCE OF AN IMPORTANT MODERATOR, SOCIAL MEDIA NEWS TRUST, THAT HAS BEEN OVERLOOKED IN PRIOR STUDIES. THIRD, WE FURTHER PROPOSE A MODERATED MODERATION MODEL BY INCLUDING MISINFORMATION IDENTIFICATION. OUR FINDINGS SHOW THAT SOCIAL MEDIA NEWS USE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER CONSPIRACY BELIEFS, AND TRUST IN SOCIAL MEDIA NEWS WAS FOUND TO BE A SIGNIFICANT MODERATOR OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SOCIAL MEDIA NEWS USE AND CONSPIRACY BELIEFS.

272,YOUNG ADULT CANCER CAREGIVERS EXPOSURE TO CANCER MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA,"BACKGROUND: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DESCRIBE YOUNG ADULT CANCER CAREGIVERS' EXPOSURE TO CANCER MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA. METHODS: ELIGIBLE PARTICIPANTS WERE 18 TO 39 YEARS OLD, USED SOCIAL MEDIA WEEKLY, AND CARED FOR AN ADULT PATIENT WITH CANCER DIAGNOSED 6 MONTHS TO 5 YEARS BEFORE (N = 21). RECRUITMENT OCCURRED FROM AUGUST 2017 TO JUNE 2018 IN PERSON AT ONCOLOGY CLINICS AND ONLINE. SEMISTRUCTURED TELEPHONE INTERVIEWS WERE RECORDED AND ANALYZED WITH GROUNDED THEORY METHODS THROUGH 2 ROUNDS OF CODING (<U+039A> = 0.88). RESULTS: CAREGIVERS WERE ON AVERAGE 29.1 YEARS OLD, FEMALE (76.2%), NON-HISPANIC WHITE (90.5%), COLLEGE EDUCATED (57.1%), AND CARING FOR A SPOUSE/PARTNER (47.6%). CAREGIVERS WERE EXPOSED TO A VARIETY OF CANCER MISINFORMATION TOPICS; SOME FELT UNCERTAIN IN THEIR CAREGIVING ABILITY WHEN CONFRONTED WITH CANCER MISINFORMATION. CAREGIVERS CROSSCHECKED ONLINE SOURCES AND CONSULTED TRUSTED INDIVIDUALS (EG, FAMILY, FRIENDS, AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS) TO DETERMINE THE QUALITY OF CANCER-RELATED INFORMATION AND MANAGE CANCER MISINFORMATION. CONCLUSIONS: CANCER MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA MAY INFLUENCE CAREGIVING BEHAVIORS AND DECISION MAKING. WHETHER CAREGIVERS CORRECTLY AND CONSISTENTLY IDENTIFY CANCER MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA IS UNKNOWN. SUPPORTING DIGITAL LITERACY TO MITIGATE CANCER MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA MAY IMPROVE YOUNG CANCER CAREGIVERS' ACCESS TO CREDIBLE CANCER INFORMATION. LAY SUMMARY: CANCER MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA AFFECTS YOUNG ADULT CANCER CAREGIVERS' PERCEPTIONS OF THEIR SOCIAL SUPPORT NETWORK.

300,IDENTIFYING AND ANALYZING HEALTHRELATED THEMES IN DISINFORMATION SHARED BY CONSERVATIVE AND LIBERAL RUSSIAN TROLLS ON TWITTER,"TO COMBAT HEALTH DISINFORMATION SHARED ONLINE, THERE IS A NEED TO IDENTIFY AND CHARACTERIZE THE PREVALENCE OF TOPICS SHARED BY TROLLS MANAGED BY INDIVIDUALS TO PROMOTE DISCORD. THE CURRENT LITERATURE IS LIMITED TO A FEW HEALTH TOPICS AND DOMINATED BY VACCINATION. THE GOAL OF THIS STUDY IS TO IDENTIFY AND ANALYZE THE BREADTH OF HEALTH TOPICS DISCUSSED BY LEFT (LIBERAL) AND RIGHT (CONSERVATIVE) RUSSIAN TROLLS ON TWITTER. WE INTRODUCE AN AUTOMATED FRAMEWORK BASED ON MIXED METHODS INCLUDING BOTH COMPUTATIONAL AND QUALITATIVE TECHNIQUES. RESULTS SUGGEST THAT RUSSIAN TROLLS DISCUSSED 48 HEALTH-RELATED TOPICS, RANGING FROM DIET TO ABORTION. OUT OF THE 48 TOPICS, THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE (P-VALUE = 0.004) BETWEEN LEFT AND RIGHT TROLLS BASED ON 17 TOPICS. HILLARY CLINTONÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S HEALTH DURING THE 2016 ELECTION WAS THE MOST POPULAR TOPIC FOR RIGHT TROLLS, WHO DISCUSSED THIS TOPIC SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THAN LEFT TROLLS. MENTAL HEALTH WAS THE MOST POPULAR TOPIC FOR LEFT TROLLS, WHO DISCUSSED THIS TOPIC SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THAN RIGHT TROLLS. THIS STUDY SHOWS THAT HEALTH DISINFORMATION IS A GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH THREAT ON SOCIAL MEDIA FOR A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF HEALTH TOPICS. THIS STUDY CAN BE BENEFICIAL FOR RESEARCHERS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN POLITICAL DISINFORMATION AND HEALTH MONITORING, COMMUNICATION, AND PROMOTION ON SOCIAL MEDIA BY SHOWING HEALTH INFORMATION SHARED BY RUSSIAN TROLLS.

409,PREVALENCE OF MISINFORMATION AND FACTCHECKS ON THE COVID19 PANDEMIC IN 35 COUNTRIES OBSERVATIONAL INFODEMIOLOGY STUDY,"BACKGROUND: THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS BEEN ACCOMPANIED BY AN INFODEMIC, IN WHICH A PLETHORA OF FALSE INFORMATION HAS BEEN RAPIDLY DISSEMINATED ONLINE, LEADING TO SERIOUS HARM WORLDWIDE. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY AIMS TO ANALYZE THE PREVALENCE OF COMMON MISINFORMATION RELATED TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. METHODS: WE CONDUCTED AN ONLINE SURVEY VIA SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS AND A SURVEY COMPANY TO DETERMINE WHETHER RESPONDENTS HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO A BROAD SET OF FALSE CLAIMS AND FACT-CHECKED INFORMATION ON THE DISEASE. RESULTS: WE OBTAINED MORE THAN 41,000 RESPONSES FROM 1257 PARTICIPANTS IN 85 COUNTRIES, BUT FOR OUR ANALYSIS, WE ONLY INCLUDED RESPONSES FROM 35 COUNTRIES THAT HAD AT LEAST 15 RESPONDENTS. WE IDENTIFIED A STRONG NEGATIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN A COUNTRYÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT PER-CAPITA AND THE PREVALENCE OF MISINFORMATION, WITH POORER COUNTRIES HAVING A HIGHER PREVALENCE OF MISINFORMATION (SPEARMAN <U+03A1>=Ã¢â‚¬â€œ0.72; P<.001). WE ALSO FOUND THAT FACT CHECKS SPREAD TO A LESSER DEGREE THAN THEIR RESPECTIVE FALSE CLAIMS, FOLLOWING A SUBLINEAR TREND (<U+0392>=.64). CONCLUSIONS: OUR RESULTS IMPLY THAT THE POTENTIAL HARM OF MISINFORMATION COULD BE MORE SUBSTANTIAL FOR LOW-INCOME COUNTRIES THAN HIGH-INCOME COUNTRIES. COUNTRIES WITH POOR INFRASTRUCTURES MIGHT HAVE TO COMBAT NOT ONLY THE SPREADING PANDEMIC BUT ALSO THE COVID-19 INFODEMIC, WHICH CAN DERAIL EFFORTS IN SAVING LIVES.

416,DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE OF VACCINE MISINFORMATION ON YOUTUBE NETWORK EXPOSURE STUDY,"BACKGROUND: SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS SUCH AS YOUTUBE ARE HOTBEDS FOR THE SPREAD OF MISINFORMATION ABOUT VACCINES. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXPLORE HOW INDIVIDUALS ARE EXPOSED TO ANTIVACCINE MISINFORMATION ON YOUTUBE BASED ON WHETHER THEY START THEIR VIEWING FROM A KEYWORD-BASED SEARCH OR FROM ANTIVACCINE SEED VIDEOS. METHODS: FOUR NETWORKS OF VIDEOS BASED ON YOUTUBE RECOMMENDATIONS WERE COLLECTED IN NOVEMBER 2019. TWO SEARCH NETWORKS WERE CREATED FROM PROVACCINE AND ANTIVACCINE KEYWORDS TO RESEMBLE GOAL-ORIENTED BROWSING. TWO SEED NETWORKS WERE CONSTRUCTED FROM CONSPIRACY AND ANTIVACCINE EXPERT SEED VIDEOS TO RESEMBLE DIRECT NAVIGATION. VIDEO CONTENTS AND NETWORK STRUCTURES WERE ANALYZED USING THE NETWORK EXPOSURE MODEL. RESULTS: VIEWERS ARE MORE LIKELY TO ENCOUNTER ANTIVACCINE VIDEOS THROUGH DIRECT NAVIGATION STARTING FROM AN ANTIVACCINE VIDEO THAN THROUGH GOAL-ORIENTED BROWSING. IN THE TWO SEED NETWORKS, PROVACCINE VIDEOS, ANTIVACCINE VIDEOS, AND VIDEOS CONTAINING HEALTH MISINFORMATION WERE ALL FOUND TO BE MORE LIKELY TO LEAD TO MORE ANTIVACCINE VIDEOS. CONCLUSIONS: YOUTUBE HAS BOOSTED THE SEARCH RANKINGS OF PROVACCINE VIDEOS TO COMBAT THE INFLUENCE OF ANTIVACCINE INFORMATION. HOWEVER, WHEN VIEWERS ARE DIRECTED TO ANTIVACCINE VIDEOS ON YOUTUBE FROM ANOTHER SITE, THE RECOMMENDATION ALGORITHM IS STILL LIKELY TO EXPOSE THEM TO ADDITIONAL ANTIVACCINE INFORMATION.

THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES WHETHER GIVING PRIMACY TO THE SOURCE OF MISINFORMATION ON FACEBOOK INFLUENCES USERS' SHARING BEHAVIOUR. TWO EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES SHOW THAT WHEN FAKE NEWS IS PRESENTED IN A SOURCE-PRIMACY FORMAT, USERS ARE LESS LIKELY TO SHARE THE POST BECAUSE OF REDUCED TRUST IN THE MESSAGE AND INCREASED PERCEPTIONS OF DECEPTIVE INTENT. ADDITIONALLY, THIS EFFECT PERSISTS ONLY WHEN THE PERSON SHARING THE FAKE NEWS HAS A WEAK INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE RECEIVER. THE STUDY EXTENDS CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF HOW MISINFORMATION IS SHARED AND PROVIDES INSIGHTS INTO HOW PRESENTATION FORMATS CAN BE USED TO LIMIT THE SPREAD OF FAKE NEWS WITHOUT RESTRICTING FREEDOM OF SPEECH.

232,THE GLOBAL EFFECTIVENESS OF FACTCHECKING EVIDENCE FROM SIMULTANEOUS EXPERIMENTS IN ARGENTINA NIGERIA SOUTH AFRICA AND THE UNITED KINGDOM,"THE SPREAD OF MISINFORMATION IS A GLOBAL PHENOMENON, WITH IMPLICATIONS FOR ELECTIONS, STATE-SANCTIONED VIOLENCE, AND HEALTH OUTCOMES. YET, EVEN THOUGH SCHOLARS HAVE INVESTIGATED THE CAPACITY OF FACT-CHECKING TO REDUCE BELIEF IN MISINFORMATION, LITTLE EVIDENCE EXISTS ON THE GLOBAL EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS APPROACH. WE DESCRIBE FACT-CHECKING EXPERIMENTS CONDUCTED SIMULTANEOUSLY IN ARGENTINA, NIGERIA, SOUTH AFRICA, AND THE UNITED KINGDOM, IN WHICH WE STUDIED WHETHER FACT-CHECKING CAN DURABLY REDUCE BELIEF IN MISINFORMATION. IN TOTAL, WE EVALUATED 22 FACT-CHECKS, INCLUDING TWO THAT WERE TESTED IN ALL FOUR COUNTRIES. FACT-CHECKING REDUCED BELIEF IN MISINFORMATION, WITH MOST EFFECTS STILL APPARENT MORE THAN 2 WK LATER. A META-ANALYTIC PROCEDURE INDICATES THAT FACTCHECKS REDUCED BELIEF IN MISINFORMATION BY AT LEAST 0.59 POINTS ON A 5-POINT SCALE. EXPOSURE TO MISINFORMATION, HOWEVER, ONLY INCREASED FALSE BELIEFS BY LESS THAN 0.07 POINTS ON THE SAME SCALE. ACROSS CONTINENTS, FACT-CHECKS REDUCE BELIEF IN MISINFORMATION, OFTEN DURABLY SO.

245,THE INSTAGRAM INFODEMIC COBRANDING OF CONSPIRACY THEORIES CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 AND AUTHORITYQUESTIONING BELIEFS,"THE NOVEL CORONAVIRUS 2019 PANDEMIC HAS BROUGHT ABOUT AN OVERABUNDANCE OF MISINFORMATION CONCERNING THE VIRUS (SARS-COV-2) AND THE CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 (COVID-19) IT CAUSES SPREADING RAPIDLY ON SOCIAL MEDIA. WHILE SOME MORE OBVIOUSLY UNTRUSTWORTHY SOURCES MAY BE EASIER FOR SOCIAL MEDIA FILTERS TO IDENTIFY AND REMOVE, AN EARLY FEATURE WAS THE COBRANDING OF COVID-19 MISINFORMATION WITH OTHER TYPES OF MISINFORMATION. TO EXAMINE THIS, THE TOP 10 INSTAGRAM POSTS (IN ENGLISH) WERE COLLECTED EVERY DAY FOR 10 DAYS (APRIL 21-30TH, 2020) FOR EACH OF THE HASHTAGS #HOAX, #GOVERNMENTLIES, AND #PLANDEMIC. THE #HOAX WAS SELECTED FIRST AS IT IS COMMONLY USED IN CONSPIRACY THEORY POSTS, AND #GOVERNMENTLIES BECAUSE IT WAS THE MOST COMMONLY COTAGGED WITH #HOAX. FOR COMPARISON, WE SELECTED #PLANDEMIC AS THE MOST POPULAR COTAGGED HASHTAG THAT WAS CLEARLY COVID-19-RELATED. THIS RESULTED IN 300 INSTAGRAM POSTS AVAILABLE FOR OUR ANALYSIS. WE CONDUCTED A CONTENT ANALYSIS BY CODING THE THEMES CONTAINED IN THE POSTS, BOTH FOR THE IMAGES AND THE TEXT CAPTION SHARED BY THE INSTAGRAM USERS (INCLUDING HASHTAGS). THE BROAD THEME OF GENERAL MISTRUST WAS THE MOST COMMON, INCLUDING THE IDEA THAT THE GOVERNMENT AND/OR MEDIA HAS FABRICATED OR HIDDEN INFORMATION PERTAINING TO COVID-19. CONSPIRACY THEORIES WERE THE SECOND-MOST FREQUENT THEME AMONG POSTS. OVERALL, COVID-19 WAS FREQUENTLY PRESENTED IN ASSOCIATION WITH AUTHORITY-QUESTIONING BELIEFS. DEVELOPING AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE PUBLIC SHARES MISINFORMATION ON COVID-19 ALONGSIDE CONSPIRACY THEORIES AND AUTHORITY-QUESTIONING STATEMENTS CAN AID PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS AND POLICYMAKERS IN LIMITING THE SPREAD OF POTENTIALLY LIFE-THREATENING HEALTH MISINFORMATION.

261,USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TECHNIQUES FOR DETECTING COVID19 EPIDEMIC FAKE NEWS IN MOROCCAN TWEETS,"DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF DATA TRAVELS FAST WORLDWIDE ON THE NET, MAINLY ON THE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM WHERE PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD HAVE CONSTANT AND EASY ACCESS TO SUBMIT MATERIALS AND POSTS. A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF SHARED NEWS EMBEDS MISLEADING INFORMATION WHICH AFFECTS NEGATIVELY THE COGNITIVE AND PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH OF ITS READERS. THE PRESENT CASE STUDY FOCUSES ON FAKE NEWS BEING TWEETED DURING THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC FOR THE PURPOSE TO MISLEAD THE TARGETED POPULATION. IN THIS CONTEXT, THIS PAPER EXHIBITS A NEW APPROACH TO DETECT FAKE NEWS ON TWITTER DURING THE COVID-19 PERIOD. THE PROPOSED METHOD CONSISTS OF A CLASSIFICATION APPROACH THAT USES NEW TWEETSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ FEATURES AND IT IS BASED ON NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING, MACHINE LEARNING, AND DEEP LEARNING. THE METHOD IS IMPLEMENTED IN PARALLEL WITH APACHE SPARK. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOW THAT OUR APPROACH YIELDS VERY VALUABLE RESULTS ONCE IT IS USED WITH THE RANDOM FOREST ALGORITHM WITH AN ACCURACY EQUAL TO 79%. WE ALSO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE SENTIMENT OF TWEETS PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE DETECTION OF FAKE NEWS. INDEED, THE MODEL WE PRESENT OUTPERFORMS THOSE MODELS LACKING CONSIDERATION OF NEW TWEETSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ FEATURES.

IN THIS PAPER, WE INVESTIGATE HOW TOPIC DIVERSITY (I.E., HOMOGENEITY OF OPINIONS IN A TOPIC) DEPENDS ON THE TRUTHFULNESS OF A TOPIC (WHETHER IT IS A RUMOR OR A NON-RUMOR) AND HOW THE TOPIC DIVERSITY CHANGES IN TIME AFTER A DISASTER. TO DO SO, WE DEVELOP A METHOD FOR QUANTIFYING THE TOPIC DIVERSITY OF THE TWEET DATA BASED ON TEXT CONTENT. THE PROPOSED METHOD IS BASED ON CLUSTERING A TWEET GRAPH USING DATA POLISHING THAT AUTOMATICALLY DETERMINES THE NUMBER OF SUBTOPICS. WE PERFORM A CASE STUDY OF TWEETS POSTED AFTER THE EAST JAPAN GREAT EARTHQUAKE ON MARCH 11, 2011. WE FIND THAT RUMOR TOPICS EXHIBIT MORE HOMOGENEITY OF OPINIONS IN A TOPIC DURING DIFFUSION THAN NON-RUMOR TOPICS.

269,MARKETING OF TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL FUMARATE TDF LAWSUITS AND SOCIAL MEDIA MISINFORMATION CAMPAIGNS IMPACT ON PREP UPTAKE AMONG GENDER AND SEXUAL MINORITY INDIVIDUALS,"THERE HAS BEEN AN INFLUX OF ADS ON SOCIAL MEDIA SEEKING PLAINTIFFS IN LAWSUITS FOR HARMS/SIDE-EFFECTS CAUSED BY TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL FUMARATE/EMTRICITABINE (TDF/FTC, TRUVADA) FOR PREP. COMMUNITY GROUPS AND RESEARCHERS HAVE SUGGESTED THESE ADS MAY BE UNDERMINING EFFORTS TO DISSEMINATE PREP TO KEY POPULATIONS. IN OCTOBER 2019, WE BEGAN ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF INJURY LAWSUIT ADS ON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS IN AN ONGOING U.S. NATIONAL COHORT STUDY OF HIV-NEGATIVE CIS MEN, TRANS MEN, AND TRANS WOMEN WHO HAVE SEX WITH MEN. ALTHOUGH ASSESSMENTS ARE ONGOING, GIVEN THE ALARMING NATURE OF OUR FINDINGS, WE REPORT DATA COLLECTED AS OF MARCH 2020 (N = 2078). MOST (59.9%) SAID THEY HAD SEEN ADS FOR TDF-RELATED LAWSUITS ON SOCIAL MEDIA. TWENTY-EIGHT PERCENT SAID THEY WOULD PROBABLY OR DEFINITELY NOT START PREP AND 22.1% SAID THEY WOULD NOT STAY ON PREP (WERE THEY ON IT) AS A RESULT OF SEEING THESE ADS. NEXT, 38.2% AGREED OR STRONGLY AGREED THAT SEEING THESE ADS MADE THEM THINK THAT TDF/FTC FOR PREP WAS NOT SAFE. BLACK, LATINX, AND/OR MULTIRACIAL INDIVIDUALS WERE MOST LIKELY TO BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE ADS INCLUDING PERCEPTIONS THAT THESE ADS MADE THEM THINK PREP IS NOT SAFE. IN CONTRAST, PAST YEAR EXPERIENCE TAKING PREP WAS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH INTENTIONS TO START AND/OR STAY ON PREP DESPITE SEEING THE ADS. DUE TO FORTHCOMING AFFORDABLE/GENERIC OPTIONS, TDF/FTC IS PROJECTED TO BECOME THE MOST SCALABLE OPTION FOR DISSEMINATING PREP TO KEY POPULATIONS. RESULTS SUGGEST THAT ADS FOR TDF LAWSUITS ON SOCIAL MEDIA ARE HAVING A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON INDIVIDUAL PREP DECISION-MAKING. OUR FINDINGS HIGHLIGHT THE URGENCY FOR ACCURATE AND BALANCED MESSAGING ON THE BENEFITS AND RISKS OF PREP, SO THAT INDIVIDUALS CAN MAKE INFORMED CHOICES ABOUT WHETHER PREP IS RIGHT FOR THEM.

THROUGH THEORIZING AND INTEGRATING LITERATURE FROM INTERDISCIPLINARY FIELDS SUCH AS INFORMATION BEHAVIOR, COMMUNICATION AND RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT, THIS STUDY EXPLORED HOW MISINFORMATION ON FACEBOOK INFLUENCES USERS' TRUST, DISTRUST AND INTENSITY OF FACEBOOK USE. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: THIS STUDY EMPLOYED QUANTITATIVE SURVEY RESEARCH AND COLLECTED PANEL DATA VIA AN ONLINE PROFESSIONAL SURVEY PLATFORM. A TOTAL OF 661 PARTICIPANTS IN THE USA COMPLETED THIS STUDY, AND STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING (SEM) WAS USED TO TEST THE THEORETICAL MODEL USING AMOS 20. FINDINGS: BASED ON DATA FROM AN ONLINE QUESTIONNAIRE (N = 661) IN THE USA, RESULTS SHOWED THAT INFORMATION TRUSTWORTHINESS AND ELABORATION, USERS' SELF-EFFICACY OF DETECTING MISINFORMATION AND PRESCRIPTIVE EXPECTANCY OF THE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM SIGNIFICANTLY PREDICTED BOTH TRUST AND DISTRUST TOWARD FACEBOOK, WHICH IN TURN JOINTLY INFLUENCED USERS' INTENSITY OF USING THIS INFORMATION SYSTEM. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: THIS STUDY CONTRIBUTES TO THE GROWING BODY OF LITERATURE ON INFORMATION AND RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT AND DIGITAL COMMUNICATION FROM SEVERAL IMPORTANT ASPECTS. FIRST, THIS STUDY DISCLOSED THE UNDERLYING COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL PROCESSING OF ONLINE MISINFORMATION AND ADDRESSED THE STRATEGIES FOR FUTURE SYSTEM DESIGN AND BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTION OF MISINFORMATION. SECOND, THIS STUDY SYSTEMATICALLY EXAMINED BOTH TRUST AND DISTRUST AS COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE DIMENSIONS OF THE HUMAN MINDSETS, ENCOMPASSED THE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS OF THE ONLINE INFORMATION BEHAVIOR AND ENRICHED ONEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S UNDERSTANDING OF HOW MISINFORMATION AFFECTED PUBLICS' PERCEPTIONS OF THE INFORMATION SYSTEM WHERE IT APPEARED.

THE AUTHOR COLLECTED MORE THAN 550,000 INSTAGRAM POSTS SENT BY OVER 198,000 UNIQUE USERS FROM 24 FEBRUARY 2012 TO 21 DECEMBER 2018, USING THE HASHTAG #FAKENEWS AS A SEARCH TERM. THE STUDY USES TOPIC MODELLING TO IDENTIFY THE MOST RECURRENT TOPICS THAT ARE DOMINANT ON THE PLATFORM, WHILE THE MOST ACTIVE USERS ARE IDENTIFIED TO UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF THE ONLINE COMMUNITIES THAT DISCUSS FAKE NEWS. IN ADDITION, THE STUDY OFFERS AN ANALYSIS OF VISUAL METADATA THAT ACCOMPANIES INSTAGRAM IMAGES. THE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT INSTAGRAM HAS BECOME A WEAPONIZED TOXIC PLATFORM, AND THE LARGEST COMMUNITY OF ACTIVE USERS ARE SUPPORT-ERS OF THE US PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, MOSTLY TROLLING LIBERAL MAINSTREAM MEDIA ESPECIALLY CNN, WHILE OFTEN ALIGNING THEMSELVES WITH THE FAR-RIGHT. ON THE OTHER HAND, A MUCH SMALLER ONLINE COMMUNITY ATTEMPTS TO TROLL TRUMP AND THE REPUBLICANS.

417,IMPACT OF UNRELIABLE CONTENT ON SOCIAL MEDIA USERS DURING COVID19 AND STANCE DETECTION SYSTEM,"THE ABUNDANT DISSEMINATION OF MISINFORMATION REGARDING CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 (COVID-19) PRESENTS ANOTHER UNPRECEDENTED ISSUE TO THE WORLD, ALONG WITH THE HEALTH CRISIS. ONLINE SOCIAL NETWORK (OSN) PLATFORMS INTENSIFY THIS PROBLEM BY ALLOWING THEIR USERS TO EASILY DISTORT AND FABRI-CATE THE INFORMATION AND DISSEMINATE IT FARTHER AND RAPIDLY. IN THIS PAPER, WE STUDY THE IMPACT OF MISINFORMATION ASSOCIATED WITH A RELIGIOUS INFLECTION ON THE PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIOR OF THE OSN USERS. THE ARTICLE PRESENTS A DETAILED STUDY TO UNDERSTAND THE REACTION OF SOCIAL MEDIA USERS WHEN EXPOSED TO UNVERIFIED CONTENT RELATED TO THE ISLAMIC COMMUNITY DURING THE COVID-19 LOCKDOWN PERIOD IN INDIA. THE ANALYSIS WAS CARRIED OUT ON TWITTER USERS WHERE THE DATA WERE COLLECTED USING THREE SCRAPING PACKAGES, TWEEPY, SELENIUM, AND BEAUTIFUL SOUP, TO COVER MORE USERS AFFECTED BY THIS MISINFORMATION. A LABELED DATASET IS PREPARED WHERE EACH TWEET IS ASSIGNED ONE OF THE FOUR REACTION POLARITIES, NAMELY, E (ENDORSE), D (DENY), Q (QUESTION), AND N (NEUTRAL). ANALYSIS OF COLLECTED DATA WAS CARRIED OUT IN FIVE PHASES WHERE WE INVESTIGATE THE ENGAGEMENT OF E, D, Q, AND N USERS, TONE OF THE TWEETS, AND THE CONSEQUENCE UPON REPEATED EXPOSURE OF SUCH INFORMATION. THE EVIDENCE DEMONSTRATES THAT THE CIRCULATION OF SUCH CONTENT DURING THE PANDEMIC AND LOCKDOWN PHASE HAD MADE PEOPLE MORE VULNERABLE IN PERCEIVING THE UNRELIABLE TWEETS AS FACT. IT WAS ALSO OBSERVED THAT PEOPLE ABSORBED THE NEGATIVITY OF THE ONLINE CONTENT, WHICH INDUCED A FEELING OF HATRED, ANGER, DISTRESS, AND FEAR AMONG THEM. PEOPLE WITH SIMILAR MINDSET FORM ONLINE GROUPS AND EXPRESS THEIR NEGATIVE ATTITUDE TO OTHER GROUPS BASED ON THEIR OPINIONS, INDICATING THE STRONG SIGNALS OF SOCIAL UNREST AND PUBLIC TENSIONS IN SOCIETY. THE PAPER ALSO PRESENTS A DEEP LEARNING-BASED STANCE DETECTION MODEL AS ONE OF THE AUTOMATED MECHANISMS FOR TRACKING THE NEWS ON TWITTER AS BEING POTENTIALLY FALSE. STANCE CLASSIFIER AIMS TO PREDICT THE ATTITUDE OF A TWEET TOWARDS A NEWS HEADLINE AND THEREBY ASSISTS IN DETERMINING THE VERACITY OF NEWS BY MONITORING THE DISTRIBUTION OF DIFFERENT REACTIONS OF THE USERS TOWARDS IT. THE PROPOSED MODEL, EMPLOYING DEEP LEARNING (CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN)) AND SENTENCE EMBEDDING (BIDIRECTIONAL ENCODER REPRESENTATIONS FROM TRANSFORMERS (BERT)) TECHNIQUES, OUTPERFORMS THE EXISTING SYSTEMS.

585,HEALTH INFORMATION SEEKING BEHAVIORS ON SOCIAL MEDIA DURING THE COVID19 PANDEMIC AMONG AMERICAN SOCIAL NETWORKING SITE USERS SURVEY STUDY,"BACKGROUND: IN RECENT YEARS, MEDICAL JOURNALS HAVE EMPHASIZED THE INCREASINGLY CRITICAL ROLE THAT SOCIAL MEDIA PLAYS IN THE DISSEMINATION OF PUBLIC HEALTH INFORMATION AND DISEASE PREVENTION GUIDELINES. HOWEVER, PLATFORMS SUCH AS FACEBOOK AND TWITTER CONTINUE TO POSE UNIQUE CHALLENGES FOR CLINICAL HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS ALIKE. IN ORDER TO EFFECTIVELY COMMUNICATE DURING PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES, SUCH AS THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, IT IS INCREASINGLY CRITICAL FOR HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS TO UNDERSTAND HOW PATIENTS GATHER HEALTH-RELATED INFORMATION ON THE INTERNET AND ADJUDICATE THE MERITS OF SUCH INFORMATION. OBJECTIVE: WITH THAT GOAL IN MIND, WE CONDUCTED A SURVEY OF 1003 US-BASED ADULTS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW HEALTH CONSUMERS HAVE USED SOCIAL MEDIA TO LEARN AND STAY INFORMED ABOUT THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, THE EXTENT TO WHICH THEY HAVE RELIED ON CREDIBLE SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION SOURCES, AND HOW THEY HAVE GONE ABOUT FACT-CHECKING PANDEMIC-RELATED INFORMATION. METHODS: A WEB-BASED SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED WITH A SAMPLE THAT WAS PURCHASED THROUGH AN INDUSTRY-LEADING MARKET RESEARCH PROVIDER. THE RESULTS WERE REPORTED WITH A 95% CONFIDENCE LEVEL AND A MARGIN OF ERROR OF 3. PARTICIPANTS INCLUDED 1003 US-BASED ADULTS (AGED =18 YEARS). PARTICIPANTS WERE SELECTED VIA A STRATIFIED QUOTA SAMPLING APPROACH TO ENSURE THAT THE SAMPLE WAS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE US POPULATION. BALANCED QUOTAS WERE DETERMINED (BY REGION OF THE COUNTRY) FOR GENDER, AGE, RACE, AND ETHNICITY. RESULTS: THE RESULTS SHOWED A HEAVY RELIANCE ON SOCIAL MEDIA DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC; MORE THAN THREE-QUARTERS OF RESPONDENTS (762/1003, 76%) REPORTED THAT THEY HAVE RELIED ON SOCIAL MEDIA AT LEAST ""A LITTLE,"" AND 59.2% (594/1003) OF RESPONDENTS INDICATED THAT THEY READ INFORMATION ABOUT COVID-19 ON SOCIAL MEDIA AT LEAST ONCE PER WEEK. ACCORDING TO THE FINDINGS, MOST SOCIAL MEDIA USERS (638/1003, 63.6%) WERE UNLIKELY TO FACT-CHECK WHAT THEY SEE ON THE INTERNET WITH A HEALTH PROFESSIONAL, DESPITE THE HIGH LEVELS OF MISTRUST IN THE ACCURACY OF COVID-19-RELATED INFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA. WE ALSO FOUND A GREATER LIKELIHOOD OF UNDERGOING VACCINATION AMONG THOSE FOLLOWING MORE CREDIBLE SCIENTIFIC SOURCES ON SOCIAL MEDIA DURING THE PANDEMIC (CHI(2)(16)=50.790; PHI=0.258; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WILL NEED TO BE BOTH STRATEGIC AND PROACTIVE WHEN ENGAGING WITH HEALTH CONSUMERS ON SOCIAL MEDIA IF THEY HOPE TO COUNTERACT THE DELETERIOUS EFFECTS OF MISINFORMATION AND DISINFORMATION.

197,MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL NETWORKS DURING THE NOVEL CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC A QUALIQUANTITATIVE CASE STUDY OF BRAZIL,"BACKGROUND: ONE OF THE CHALLENGES POSED BY THE NOVEL CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC IS THE INFODEMIC RISK, THAT IS, A HUGE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION BEING PUBLISHED ON THE TOPIC, ALONG WITH MISINFORMATION AND RUMOURS; WITH SOCIAL MEDIA, THIS PHENOMENON IS AMPLIFIED, AND IT GOES FASTER AND FURTHER. AROUND 100 MILLION PEOPLE IN BRAZIL (50% OF THE INHABITANTS) ARE USERS OF SOCIAL MEDIA NETWORKS Ã¢â‚¬â€œ ALMOST HALF OF THE COUNTRYÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S POPULATION. MOST OF THE INFORMATION ON THE INTERNET IS UNREGULATED, AND ITS QUALITY REMAINS QUESTIONABLE. METHODS: IN THIS STUDY, WE EXAMINE THE MAIN CHARACTERISTICS OF MISINFORMATION PUBLISHED ON THE TOPIC. WE ANALYSED 232 PIECES OF MISINFORMATION PUBLISHED BY THE BRAZILIAN FACT-CHECKING SERVICE Ã¢â‚¬Å“AGÃƒÅ NCIA LUPAÃ¢â‚¬Â. THE FOLLOWING ASPECTS OF EACH NEWS ITEM WERE ANALYSED: A) IN WHAT SOCIAL MEDIA HAS IT CIRCULATED?; B) WHAT IS THE CONTENT CLASSIFICATION, SENTIMENT AND TYPE OF MISINFORMATION?; D) ARE THERE RECURRENT THEMES IN THE SAMPLE STUDIED? RESULTS: MOST WERE PUBLISHED ON FACEBOOK (76%), FOLLOWED BY WHATSAPP, WITH 10% OF TOTAL CASES. HALF OF THE STORIES (47%) ARE CLASSIFIED AS Ã¢â‚¬Å“REAL-LIFEÃ¢â‚¬Â, THAT IS, THE FOCUS IS ON EVERYDAY SITUATIONS, OR CIRCUMSTANCES INVOLVING PEOPLE. REGARDING THE TYPE OF MISINFORMATION, THERE IS A PREPONDERANCE OF FABRICATED CONTENT, WITH 53% OF TOTAL, FOLLOWED BY FALSE CONTEXT (34%) AND MISLEADING CONTENT (13%). WRONG INFORMATION WAS MOSTLY PUBLISHED IN TEXT FORMAT (47%). WE FOUND THAT 92.9% OF MISINFORMATION CLASSIFIED AS Ã¢â‚¬Å“FABRICATED CONTENTÃ¢â‚¬Â ARE Ã¢â‚¬Å“HEALTH TIPSÃ¢â‚¬Â, AND 88.9% OF Ã¢â‚¬Å“VIRTUAL SCAMSÃ¢â‚¬Â ARE ALSO FABRICATED. CONCLUSION: BRAZILIAN MEDIA AND SCIENCE COMMUNICATORS MUST UNDERSTAND THE MAIN CHARACTERISTICS OF MISINFORMATION IN SOCIAL MEDIA ABOUT COVID-19, SO THAT THEY CAN DEVELOP ATTRACTIVE, UP-TO-DATE AND EVIDENCE-BASED CONTENT THAT HELPS TO INCREASE HEALTH LITERACY AND COUNTERACT THE SPREAD OF FALSE INFORMATION.

200,LEARNING ABOUT COVID19 A QUALITATIVE INTERVIEW STUDY OF AUSTRALIANS USE OF INFORMATION SOURCES,"BACKGROUND: A MULTITUDE OF INFORMATION SOURCES ARE AVAILABLE TO PUBLICS WHEN NOVEL INFECTIOUS DISEASES FIRST EMERGE. IN THIS PAPER, WE ADOPT A QUALITATIVE APPROACH TO INVESTIGATE HOW AUSTRALIANS LEARNT ABOUT THE NOVEL CORONAVIRUS AND COVID-19 AND WHAT SOURCES OF INFORMATION THEY HAD FOUND MOST USEFUL AND VALUABLE DURING THE EARLY MONTHS OF THE PANDEMIC. METHODS: IN-DEPTH SEMI-STRUCTURED TELEPHONE INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH A DIVERSE GROUP OF 40 AUSTRALIAN ADULTS IN MID-2020 ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES OF THE COVID-19 CRISIS. PARTICIPANTS WERE RECRUITED THROUGH FACEBOOK ADVERTISING. DETAILED CASE STUDIES WERE CREATED FOR EACH PARTICIPANT, PROVIDING THE BASIS OF A THEMATIC ANALYSIS WHICH FOCUSED ON THE PARTICIPANTSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ RESPONSES TO THE QUESTIONS ABOUT COVID-19-RELATED INFORMATION SOURCES. RESULTS: DIVERSE SOURCES OF COVID-19-RELATED INFORMATION, INCLUDING TRADITIONAL MEDIA, ONLINE MEDIA AND IN-PERSON INTERACTIONS, WERE ACTIVELY ACCESSED, APPRAISED AND ENGAGED WITH BY PARTICIPANTS. THERE WAS A HIGH LEVEL OF INTEREST IN COVID-19 INFORMATION AS PEOPLE GRAPPLED WITH UNCERTAINTY, ANXIETY AND FEELING OVERWHELMED. CERTAIN KEY EVENTS OR EXPERIENCES MADE PEOPLE BECOME AWARE THAT THE OUTBREAK WAS THREATENING AUSTRALIA AND POTENTIALLY THEMSELVES. MOST PEOPLE DEMONSTRATED KEEN AWARENESS THAT MISINFORMATION WAS RIFE IN NEWS OUTLETS AND SOCIAL MEDIA SITES AND THAT THEY WERE TAKING STEPS TO DETERMINE THE ACCURACY OF INFORMATION. HIGH TRUST WAS PLACED IN HEALTH EXPERTS, SCIENTISTS AND GOVERNMENT SOURCES TO PROVIDE RELIABLE INFORMATION. ALSO IMPORTANT TO PARTICIPANTS WERE INFORMAL DISCUSSIONS WITH FRIENDS AND FAMILY MEMBERS WHO WERE EXPERTS OR WORKING IN RELEVANT FIELDS, AS WELL AS ENGAGING IN-PERSON IN INTERACTIONS AND HEARING FROM FRIENDS AND FAMILY WHO LIVED OVERSEAS ABOUT WHAT COVID-19 CONDITIONS WERE LIKE THERE. CONCLUSION: A CONSTANTLY CHANGING NEWS ENVIRONMENT RAISES CHALLENGES FOR EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION OF RISK AND CONTAINMENT ADVICE. PEOPLE CAN BECOME CONFUSED, DISTRESSED AND OVERWHELMED BY THE PLETHORA OF INFORMATION SOURCES AND FAST-CHANGING NEWS ENVIRONMENT. ON THE OTHER HAND, SEEKING OUT INFORMATION CAN PROVIDE REASSURANCE AND COMFORT IN RESPONSE TO ANXIETY AND UNCERTAINTY. CLARITY AND CONSISTENCY IN RISK MESSAGING IS IMPORTANT, AS IS RESPONDING QUICKLY TO CHANGES IN INFORMATION AND MISINFORMATION.

242,CHARACTERIZING COVID19 CONTENT POSTED TO TIKTOK PUBLIC SENTIMENT AND RESPONSE DURING THE FIRST PHASE OF THE COVID19 PANDEMIC,"PURPOSE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO CHARACTERIZE COVID-19 CONTENT POSTED BY USERS AND DISSEMINATED VIA TIKTOK, A SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM THAT HAS BECOME KNOWN LARGELY AS AN ENTERTAINMENT PLATFORM FOR VIRAL VIDEO-SHARING. WE SOUGHT TO CAPTURE HOW TIKTOK VIDEOS POSTED DURING THE INITIAL MONTHS OF THE COVID PANDEMIC CHANGED OVER TIME AS CASES ACCELERATED. METHODS: THIS STUDY IS AN OBSERVATIONAL ANALYSIS OF SEQUENTIAL TIKTOK VIDEOS WITH #CORONAVIRUS FROM JANUARY TO MARCH 2020. VIDEOS WERE INDEPENDENTLY CODED TO ASSESS CONTENT (E.G., HEALTH RELATEDNESS, HUMOR, FEAR, EMPATHY), MISINFORMATION, AND PUBLIC SENTIMENT. TO ASSESS ENGAGEMENT, WE ALSO CODIFIED HOW OFTEN VIDEOS WERE SHARED RELATIVE TO THEIR CONTENT. RESULTS: WE CODED 750 VIDEOS AND APPROXIMATELY ONE IN FOUR VIDEOS TAGGED WITH #CORONAVIRUS FEATURED HEALTH-RELATED CONTENT SUCH AS FEATURING OBJECTS SUCH AS FACE MASKS, HAND SANITIZER, AND OTHER CLEANING PRODUCTS. MOST VIDEOS EVOKED Ã¢â‚¬Å“HUMOR/PARODY,Ã¢â‚¬Â WHEREAS 15% AND 6% EVOKED Ã¢â‚¬Å“FEARÃ¢â‚¬Â AND Ã¢â‚¬Å“EMPATHYÃ¢â‚¬Â, RESPECTIVELY. TIKTOK VIDEOS POSTED IN MARCH 2020 HAD THE LARGEST NUMBER OF SHARES AND COMMENTS COMPARED WITH JANUARY AND FEBRUARY 2020. THE PROPORTION OF SHARES AND COMMENTS FOR Ã¢â‚¬Å“MISLEADING AND INCORRECT INFORMATIONÃ¢â‚¬Â FEATURED IN VIDEOS WAS LOWER IN MARCH THAN IN JANUARY AND FEBRUARY 2020. THERE WAS NO STATISTICAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SHARE AND COMMENT COUNTS OF VIDEOS CODED AS Ã¢â‚¬Å“INCORRECT/INCOMPLETEÃ¢â‚¬Â AND Ã¢â‚¬Å“CORRECTÃ¢â‚¬Â OVER THE ENTIRE TIME PERIOD. CONCLUSIONS: ANALYZING READILY AVAILABLE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS, SUCH AS TIKTOK PROVIDES REAL-TIME INSIGHTS INTO PUBLIC VIEWS, FREQUENCY AND TYPES OF MISINFORMATION, AND NORMS TOWARD COVID-19. ANALYZING TIKTOK VIDEOS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE USED TO INFORM PUBLIC HEALTH MESSAGING AND PUBLIC HEALTH MITIGATION STRATEGIES.

282,ARE YOU PASSING ALONG SOMETHING TRUE OR FALSE DISSEMINATION OF SOCIAL MEDIA MESSAGES ABOUT GENETICALLY MODIFIED ORGANISMS,"USING NETWORK ANALYSIS, THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES HOW INFORMATION VERACITY AND ACCOUNT VERIFICATION INFLUENCE THE DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION IN THE CONTEXT OF DISCOURSE ABOUT GENETICALLY MODIFIED ORGANISMS ON SOCIAL MEDIA. WE DISCOVERED THAT MISINFORMATION AND TRUE INFORMATION ABOUT GENETICALLY MODIFIED ORGANISMS DEMONSTRATED DIFFERENT DISSEMINATION PATTERNS ON SOCIAL MEDIA. IN GENERAL, THE DISSEMINATION NETWORKS OF MISINFORMATION ABOUT GENETICALLY MODIFIED ORGANISMS WERE FOUND TO HAVE HIGHER STRUCTURAL STABILITY THAN THOSE OF TRUE INFORMATION ABOUT GENETICALLY MODIFIED ORGANISMS, AS SHOWN BY THE DENSER NETWORK STRUCTURE WITH FEWER DISTINCT SUBGROUPS RESIDING WITHIN THE DISSEMINATION NETWORKS. MORE IMPORTANTLY, UNVERIFIED ACCOUNT STATUS SIGNIFICANTLY BOOSTED THE DISSEMINATION OF MISINFORMATION BY INCREASING NETWORK DENSITY. IN ADDITION, WE FOUND THAT THE POSTS ABOUT GENETICALLY MODIFIED ORGANISMS FROM UNVERIFIED ACCOUNTS RECEIVED MORE REPOSTS AND HAD MORE LAYERS OF INFORMATION RELAY THAN THOSE FROM THE VERIFIED ACCOUNTS. THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THESE FINDINGS ON COMBATING MISINFORMATION ARE DISCUSSED IN THE ARTICLE.

289,ECHO CHAMBER EFFECT IN RUMOR REBUTTAL DISCUSSIONS ABOUT COVID19 IN CHINA SOCIAL MEDIA CONTENT AND NETWORK ANALYSIS STUDY,"BACKGROUND: THE DISSEMINATION OF RUMOR REBUTTAL CONTENT ON SOCIAL MEDIA IS VITAL FOR RUMOR CONTROL AND DISEASE CONTAINMENT DURING PUBLIC HEALTH CRISES. PREVIOUS RESEARCH ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF RUMOR REBUTTAL, TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, IGNORED OR SIMPLIFIED THE STRUCTURE OF DISSEMINATION NETWORKS AND USERS' COGNITION AS WELL AS DECISION-MAKING AND INTERACTION BEHAVIORS. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY AIMED TO ROUGHLY EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF RUMOR REBUTTAL; DIG DEEPLY INTO THE ATTITUDE-BASED ECHO CHAMBER EFFECT ON USERS' RESPONSES TO RUMOR REBUTTAL UNDER MULTIPLE TOPICS ON WEIBO, A CHINESE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM, IN THE EARLY STAGE OF THE COVID-19 EPIDEMIC; AND EVALUATE THE ECHO CHAMBER'S IMPACT ON THE INFORMATION CHARACTERISTICS OF USER INTERACTION CONTENT. METHODS: WE USED SINA WEIBO'S APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE TO CRAWL RUMOR REBUTTAL CONTENT RELATED TO COVID-19 FROM 10 AM ON JANUARY 23, 2020, TO MIDNIGHT ON APRIL 8, 2020. USING CONTENT ANALYSIS, SENTIMENT ANALYSIS, SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS, AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS, WE FIRST ANALYZED WHETHER AND TO WHAT EXTENT THERE WAS AN ECHO CHAMBER EFFECT ON THE SHAPING OF INDIVIDUALS' ATTITUDES WHEN RETWEETING OR COMMENTING ON OTHERS' TWEETS. THEN, WE TESTED THE HETEROGENEITY OF ATTITUDE DISTRIBUTION WITHIN COMMUNITIES AND THE HOMOPHILY OF INTERACTIONS BETWEEN COMMUNITIES. BASED ON THE RESULTS AT USER AND COMMUNITY LEVELS, WE MADE COMPREHENSIVE JUDGMENTS. FINALLY, WE EXAMINED USERS' INTERACTION CONTENT FROM THREE DIMENSIONS-SENTIMENT EXPRESSION, INFORMATION SEEKING AND SHARING, AND CIVILITY-TO TEST THE IMPACT OF THE ECHO CHAMBER EFFECT. RESULTS: OUR RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE RETWEETING MECHANISM PLAYED AN ESSENTIAL ROLE IN PROMOTING POLARIZATION, AND THE COMMENTING MECHANISM PLAYED A ROLE IN CONSENSUS BUILDING. OUR RESULTS SHOWED THAT THERE MIGHT NOT BE A SIGNIFICANT ECHO CHAMBER EFFECT ON COMMUNITY INTERACTIONS AND VERIFIED THAT, COMPARED TO LIKE-MINDED INTERACTIONS, CROSS-CUTTING INTERACTIONS CONTAINED SIGNIFICANTLY MORE NEGATIVE SENTIMENT, INFORMATION SEEKING AND SHARING, AND INCIVILITY. WE FOUND THAT ONLINE USERS' INFORMATION-SEEKING BEHAVIOR WAS ACCOMPANIED BY INCIVILITY, AND INFORMATION-SHARING BEHAVIOR WAS ACCOMPANIED BY MORE NEGATIVE SENTIMENT, WHICH WAS OFTEN ACCOMPANIED BY INCIVILITY. CONCLUSIONS: OUR FINDINGS REVEALED THE EXISTENCE AND DEGREE OF AN ECHO CHAMBER EFFECT FROM MULTIPLE DIMENSIONS, SUCH AS TOPIC, INTERACTION MECHANISM, AND INTERACTION LEVEL, AND ITS IMPACT ON INTERACTION CONTENT. BASED ON THESE FINDINGS, WE PROVIDE SEVERAL SUGGESTIONS FOR PREVENTING OR ALLEVIATING GROUP POLARIZATION TO ACHIEVE BETTER RUMOR REBUTTAL. Ã‚Â© 2021 JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH.

292,MISINFORMATION DURING THE COVID19 OUTBREAK IN CHINA CULTURAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL ENTANGLEMENTS,"NOT ONLY DID COVID-19 GIVE RISE TO A GLOBAL PANDEMIC, BUT ALSO IT RESULTED IN AN INFODEMIC COMPRISING MISINFORMATION, RUMOR, AND PROPAGANDA. THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS INFODEMIC CAN ERODE PUBLIC TRUST, IMPEDE THE CONTAINMENT OF THE VIRUS, AND OUTLIVE THE PANDEMIC ITSELF. THE EVOLVING AND FRAGMENTED MEDIA LANDSCAPE, PARTICULARLY THE EXTENSIVE USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA, IS A CRUCIAL DRIVER OF THE SPREAD OF MISINFORMATION. FOCUSING ON THE CHINESE SOCIAL MEDIA WEIBO, WE COLLECTED FOUR MILLION TWEETS, FROM DECEMBER 9, 2019, TO APRIL 4, 2020, EXAMINING MISINFORMATION IDENTIFIED BY THE FACT-CHECKING PLATFORM TENCENT-A LEADING CHINESE TECH GIANT. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT THE EVOLUTION OF MISINFORMATION FOLLOWS AN ISSUE-ATTENTION CYCLE PERTAINING TO TOPICS SUCH AS CITY LOCKDOWN, CURES AND PREVENTIVE MEASURES, SCHOOL REOPENING, AND FOREIGN COUNTRIES. SENSATIONAL AND EMOTIONALLY REASSURING MISINFORMATION CHARACTERIZES THE WHOLE ISSUE-ATTENTION CYCLE, WITH MISINFORMATION ON CURES AND PREVENTION FLOODING SOCIAL MEDIA. WE ALSO STUDY THE EVOLUTION OF SENTIMENT AND OBSERVE THAT POSITIVE SENTIMENT DOMINATED OVER THE COURSE OF COVID, WHICH MAY BE DUE TO THE UNIQUE CHARACTERISTIC OF 'POSITIVE ENERGY' ON CHINESE SOCIAL MEDIA. LASTLY, WE STUDY THE MEDIA LANDSCAPE DURING COVID VIA A CASE STUDY ON A CONTROVERSIAL UNPROVEN CURE KNOWN AS SHUANGHUANGLIAN, WHICH TESTIFIES TO THE IMPORTANCE OF SCIENTIFIC COMMUNICATION IN A PLAGUE. OUR FINDINGS SHED LIGHT ON THE DISTINCT CHARACTERISTICS OF MISINFORMATION AND ITS CULTURAL, SOCIAL, AND POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS, DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC.

FIRST, WE STUDY THE GROUP'S OPINION OVER TIME, FOCUSING ON FIVE DIMENSIONS: PARTICIPATION, SENTIMENT, NEGATIVE EMOTIONS, TOPICS, AND MESSAGE TYPES. WE FIND THAT PARTICIPATION PEAKED WHEN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH RAISED THE DISEASE ALERT LEVEL, BUT THIS ENGAGEMENT WAS NOT SUSTAINED. SECOND, WE INVESTIGATE THE PREVALENCE OF, AND REACTIONS TO, AUTHORITY-IDENTIFIED MISINFORMATION IN THE GROUP. WE FIND THAT AUTHORITY-IDENTIFIED MISINFORMATION IS RARE, AND THAT PARTICIPANTS AFFIRM, DENY, AND QUESTION MISINFORMATION.

302,DISSEMINATION AND REFUTATION OF RUMORS DURING THE COVID19 OUTBREAK IN CHINA INFODEMIOLOGY STUDY,"BACKGROUND: DURING THE OUTBREAK OF COVID-19, NUMEROUS RUMORS EMERGED ON THE INTERNET IN CHINA AND CAUSED CONFUSION AMONG THE PUBLIC. HOWEVER, THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THESE RUMORS IN DIFFERENT PHASES OF THE EPIDEMIC HAVE NOT BEEN STUDIED IN DEPTH, AND THE OFFICIAL RESPONSES TO THE RUMORS HAVE NOT BEEN SYSTEMATICALLY EVALUATED. OBJECTIVE: THE AIMS OF THIS STUDY WERE TO EVALUATE THE RUMOR EPIDEMIC AND OFFICIAL RESPONSES DURING THE COVID-19 OUTBREAK IN CHINA AND TO PROVIDE A SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR EFFECTIVE INFORMATION COMMUNICATION IN FUTURE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISES. METHODS: DATA ON INTERNET RUMORS RELATED TO COVID-19 WERE COLLECTED VIA THE SINA WEIBO OFFICIAL ACCOUNT TO REFUTE RUMORS BETWEEN JANUARY 20 AND APRIL 8, 2020, EXTRACTED, AND ANALYZED. THE DATA WERE DIVIDED INTO FIVE PERIODS ACCORDING TO THE KEY EVENTS AND DISEASE EPIDEMIC. DIFFERENT CLASSIFICATIONS OF RUMORS WERE DESCRIBED AND COMPARED OVER THE FIVE PERIODS. THE TRENDS OF THE EPIDEMIC AND THE FOCUS OF THE PUBLIC AT DIFFERENT STAGES WERE PLOTTED, AND CORRELATION ANALYSIS BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF RUMORS AND THE NUMBER OF COVID-19 CASES WAS PERFORMED. THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTIONS OF THE SOURCES AND REFUTERS OF THE RUMORS WERE GRAPHED, AND ANALYSES OF THE MOST FREQUENTLY APPEARING WORDS IN THE RUMORS WERE APPLIED TO REVEAL HOTSPOTS OF THE RUMORS. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 1943 RUMORS WERE RETRIEVED. THE MEDIAN OF THE RESPONSE INTERVAL BETWEEN PUBLICATION AND DEBUNKING OF THE RUMORS WAS 1 DAY (IQR 1-2). RUMORS IN TEXT FORMAT ACCOUNTED FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE 1943 RUMORS (N=1241, 63.9%); CHAT TOOLS, PARTICULARLY WECHAT (N=1386, 71.3%), WERE THE MOST COMMON PLATFORM FOR INITIAL PUBLISHING OF THE RUMORS (N=1412, 72.7%). IN ADDITION TO TEXT RUMORS, WEIBO AND WEB PAGES WERE MORE LIKELY TO BE PLATFORMS FOR RUMORS RELEASED IN MULTIMEDIA FORMATS OR IN A COMBINATION OF FORMATS, RESPECTIVELY. LOCAL AGENCIES PLAYED A LARGE ROLE IN DISPELLING RUMORS AMONG SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS (1537/1943, 79.1%). THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN THE FORMATS AND ORIGINS OF RUMORS OVER THE FIVE PERIODS (P<.001). HUBEI PROVINCE ACCOUNTED FOR MOST OF THE COUNTRY'S CONFIRMED RUMORS. BEIJING AND WUHAN CITY WERE THE MAIN CENTERS FOR DEBUNKING OF DISINFORMATION. THE WORDS MOST FREQUENTLY INCLUDED IN THE CORE MESSAGES OF THE RUMORS VARIED BY PERIOD, INDICATING SHIFTING IN THE PUBLIC'S CONCERN. CONCLUSIONS: CHAT TOOLS, PARTICULARLY WECHAT, BECAME THE MAJOR SOURCES OF RUMORS DURING THE COVID-19 OUTBREAK IN CHINA, INDICATING A REQUIREMENT TO ESTABLISH RUMOR MONITORING AND REFUTING MECHANISMS ON THESE PLATFORMS. MOREOVER, TARGETED POLICY ADJUSTMENTS AND TIMELY RELEASE OF OFFICIAL INFORMATION ARE NEEDED IN DIFFERENT PHASES OF THE OUTBREAK.

A CONTENT ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED ON A DATA SET OF 1,000 TWITTER POSTS. THE CORPUS OF TWEETS WAS EXAMINED USING THE PERSUASION FRAMEWORKS; TWEETS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED AS EMANATING FROM BOTS WERE FURTHER EXAMINED. RESULTS FOUND ANTI-VACCINE MESSAGES PREDOMINANTLY USED ANECDOTAL STORIES, HUMOR/SARCASM, AND CELEBRITY FIGURES AS PERSUASION TECHNIQUES, WHILE PRO-VACCINE MESSAGES PRIMARILY USED INFORMATION, CELEBRITY FIGURES, AND PARTICIPATION. RESULTS ALSO SHOWED THE ANTI-VACCINE MESSAGES PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON VALUES RELATED TO THE CATEGORIES OF SAFETY, POLITICAL/CONSPIRACY THEORIES, AND CHOICE. FINALLY, RESULTS REVEALED ANTI-VACCINE MESSAGES PRIMARILY USED PERCEIVED SEVERITY AND PERCEIVED SUSCEPTIBILITY, WHICH ARE FEAR APPEAL ELEMENTS.

USING A STUDY OF US ADULTS IN LATE MARCH 2020, WE MEASURE HOW OFTEN PEOPLE WITNESS CORRECTION, CORRECT OTHERS, OR ARE CORRECTED THEMSELVES, USING THE CASE OF COVID-19 MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA. DESCRIPTIVELY, OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT ALL THREE EXPERIENCES RELATED TO CORRECTION ON SOCIAL MEDIA ARE RELATIVELY COMMON AND OCCUR ACROSS PARTISAN DIVIDES. IMPORTANTLY, A MAJORITY OF THOSE WHO REPORT SEEING MISINFORMATION ALSO REPORT SEEING IT CORRECTED, AND A MAJORITY OF THOSE WHO REPORT SHARING MISINFORMATION REPORT BEING CORRECTED BY OTHERS. THOSE WITH MORE EDUCATION ARE MORE LIKELY TO ENGAGE IN CORRECTION, AND YOUNGER RESPONDENTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO REPORT ALL THREE EXPERIENCES WITH CORRECTION. WHILE EXPERIENCES WITH CORRECTION ARE GENERALLY UNRELATED TO MISPERCEPTIONS ABOUT COVID-19, THOSE WHO CORRECT OTHERS HAVE HIGHER COVID-19 MISPERCEPTIONS.

424,GEOSPATIAL CORRELATION BETWEEN COVID19 HEALTH MISINFORMATION AND POISONING WITH HOUSEHOLD CLEANERS IN THE GREATER BOSTON AREA,"INTRODUCTION: CALLS TO POISON CONTROL ABOUT EXPOSURE TO HOUSEHOLD CLEANERS HAVE INCREASED DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. THIS DYNAMIC MAY REFLECT INCREASED EXPOSURE FROM PUBLIC HEALTH EFFORTS AS WELL AS HEALTH MISINFORMATION SHARED ON SOCIAL MEDIA. METHODS: WE ANALYZED THE DYNAMICS OF CALLS TO THE REGIONAL CENTER FOR POISON CONTROL AND PREVENTION SERVING MASSACHUSETTS AND RHODE ISLAND (MARI PCC) AND TWEETS DISCUSSING TREATING COVID-19 WITH HOUSE CLEANERS FROM JANUARY 20, 2020 TO MAY 5, 2020. WE OBTAINED PUBLICLY AVAILABLE TWEETS DISCUSSING THE USE OF HOUSEHOLD CLEANERS TO Ã¢â‚¬Å“CURE COVIDÃ¢â‚¬Â FROM THE SAME TIME PERIOD WITH GEOGRAPHIC CO-ORDINATES INDICATING THAT THEY WERE EMITTED FROM THE GREATER BOSTON AREA. RESULTS: OUR MAIN FINDING IS THAT PUBLIC HEALTH EFFORTS WERE FOLLOWED BY A SUSTAINED INCREASE IN CALLS AFTER MARCH 15, 2020 (10 Ã‚Â± 2 CALLS PER DAY BEFORE TO 15 Ã‚Â± 2.5 AFTER) WHILE MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA WAS ASSOCIATED WITH INTERMITTENT SPIKES IN CALLS. OVERALL, CALLS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED DURING THE STUDY PERIOD BY 34% AS COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS 8 YEARS, MOSTLY REPORTING UNINTENTIONAL INGESTIONS WITH NO SERIOUS EFFECTS. THE DAILY VOLUME OF TWEETS AND RETWEETS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED WITH DAILY CALL RATES TO MARI PCC FOR THE SURROUNDING 7Ã¢â‚¬â€œ10 DAYS. CONCLUSIONS: HEALTH MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA ABOUT USING HOUSEHOLD CLEANING AGENTS TO TREAT COVID-19 AND PUBLIC HEALTH EFFORTS LEAD TO DIFFERENT DYNAMICS IN PCC CALLS. PUBLIC HEALTH EFFORTS WERE FOLLOWED BY A SUSTAINED INCREASE IN CALLS AFTER MARCH 15, 2020 WHILE MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA WAS FOLLOWED BY INTERMITTENT SPIKES IN CALLS.

FURTHERMORE, PARTICIPANTS PERCEIVED COMMENTS AS MORE CREDIBLE IF THEY CORRECTED MISINFORMATION IN A NEWS STORY, RATHER THAN REINFORCED THE MISINFORMATION. HOWEVER, NO SIGNIFICANT INTERACTION WAS FOUND BETWEEN THE TONE AND CONTENT OF COMMENTS, SUGGESTING PARTICIPANTS CONSIDERED THOSE FACTORS SEPARATELY WHEN EVALUATING CREDIBILITY OF COMMENTS.

244,GEOSPATIAL ANALYSIS OF MISINFORMATION IN COVID19 RELATED TWEETS,"COVID-19 HAS EMERGED AS A GLOBAL PANDEMIC CAUSED BY ITS HIGHLY TRANSMISSIBLE NATURE DURING THE INCUBATION PERIOD. IN THE ABSENCE OF VACCINATION, CONTAINMENT IS SEEN AS THE BEST STRATEGY TO STOP VIRUS DIFFUSION. HOWEVER, PUBLIC AWARENESS HAS BEEN ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY DISCOURSES IN SOCIAL MEDIA THAT HAVE DOWNPLAYED THE SEVERITY OF THE VIRUS AND DISSEMINATED FALSE INFORMATION. THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES COVID-19 RELATED TWITTER ACTIVITY IN MAY AND JUNE 2020 TO EXAMINE THE ORIGIN AND NATURE OF MISINFORMATION AND ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COVID-19 INCIDENCE RATE AT THE STATE AND COUNTY LEVEL. A GEODATABASE OF ALL GEOTAGGED COVID-19 RELATED TWEETS WAS COMPILED. MULTISCALE GEOGRAPHICALLY WEIGHTED REGRESSION WAS EMPLOYED TO EXAMINE THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN SOCIAL MEDIA ACTIVITY AND THE SPATIAL VARIABILITY OF DISEASE INCIDENCE. FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT MGWR COULD EXPLAIN 80% OF THE COVID-19 INCIDENCE RATE VARIATIONS INDICATING A STRONG SPATIAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SOCIAL MEDIA ACTIVITY AND SPREAD OF THE COVID-19 VIRUS.

248,PLANDEMIC REVISITED A PRODUCT OF PLANNED DISINFORMATION AMPLIFYING THE COVID19 INFODEMIC,"DURING THE FIRST FEW MONTHS OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, A 26-MIN DOCUMENTARY ENTITLED PLANDEMIC WAS RELEASED ONLINE AND FANATICALLY SHARED VIA TWITTER AND OTHER MAJOR SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS. THE PRODUCERS OF THE DOCUMENTARY SOUGHT TO SPREAD MISINFORMATION AND CONSPIRACY THEORIES AND TO DISCREDIT SCIENTIFIC EXPERTS USING A SOPHISTICATED DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN. THEY SET OUT TO ACCOMPLISH THIS BY COACHING CITIZENS TOWARD ACTIVISM TO MAXIMIZE THE SPEED AT WHICH THE DOCUMENTARY PROPAGATED AND DECREASE POSITIVE SENTIMENTS TOWARD PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTIONS. APPLYING TECHNIQUES FROM SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS IN CONJUNCTION WITH A FORMATIVE CONTENT ANALYSIS OF TWITTER DATA, WE EXAMINED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PLANDEMIC DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN AS A CASE STUDY OF SOCIAL ENGINEERING DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. BY COMPARING THE TWITTER NETWORK'S COMMUNITY STRUCTURE AND COMMUNICATION PATTERNS BEFORE AND AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE FILM, WE DEMONSTRATE THE PLANDEMIC CAMPAIGN TO HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVE FOR TWO REASONS. FIRST, THE CAMPAIGN ESTABLISHED A DECENTRALIZED INFORMATION SHARING NETWORK ON TWITTER BY COACHING LOW-REACH SOCIAL MEDIA USERS TO MASS SHARE THE DOCUMENTARY, EFFECTIVELY SUBVERTING EFFORTS TO GATEKEEP ITS MISINFORMATION. SECOND, THE CAMPAIGN AMPLIFIED NEGATIVE SENTIMENTS REGARDING VACCINATION AND CONTAINMENT MEASURES AMONG CONSPIRACY THEORISTS. THESE EFFECTS POSSIBLY HAVE AN INDIRECT IMPACT ON THE PUBLIC'S WILLINGNESS TO COMPLY WITH PUBLIC HEALTH MEASURES. OUR RESULTS SHOW THE NECESSITY OF FURTHER RESEARCH ABOUT SOPHISTICATED SOCIAL EXPERIMENTS SUCH AS THE PLANDEMIC DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN AND PROVIDE IMPORTANT INSIGHTS FOR POLICY-MAKING TO COMBAT THE SPREAD OF HEALTH MISINFORMATION DURING PUBLIC HEALTH CRISES.

252,OVERCONFIDENCE IN NEWS JUDGMENTS IS ASSOCIATED WITH FALSE NEWS SUSCEPTIBILITY,"WE EXAMINE THE ROLE OF OVERCONFIDENCE IN NEWS JUDGMENT USING TWO LARGE NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE SURVEY SAMPLES. FIRST, WE SHOW THAT THREE IN FOUR AMERICANS OVERESTIMATE THEIR RELATIVE ABILITY TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN LEGITIMATE AND FALSE NEWS HEADLINES; RESPONDENTS PLACE THEMSELVES 22 PERCENTILES HIGHER THAN WARRANTED ON AVERAGE. THIS OVERCONFIDENCE IS, IN TURN, CORRELATED WITH CONSEQUENTIAL DIFFERENCES IN REAL-WORLD BELIEFS AND BEHAVIOR. WE SHOW THAT OVERCONFIDENT INDIVIDUALS ARE MORE LIKELY TO VISIT UNTRUSTWORTHY WEBSITES IN BEHAVIORAL DATA; TO FAIL TO SUCCESSFULLY DISTINGUISH BETWEEN TRUE AND FALSE CLAIMS ABOUT CURRENT EVENTS IN SURVEY QUESTIONS; AND TO REPORT GREATER WILLINGNESS TO LIKE OR SHARE FALSE CONTENT ON SOCIAL MEDIA, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT IS POLITICALLY CONGENIAL. IN ALL, THESE RESULTS PAINT A WORRYING PICTURE: THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE LEAST EQUIPPED TO IDENTIFY FALSE NEWS CONTENT ARE ALSO THE LEAST AWARE OF THEIR OWN LIMITATIONS AND, THEREFORE, MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO BELIEVING IT AND SPREADING IT FURTHER.

259,CONSERVATIVES SUSCEPTIBILITY TO POLITICAL MISPERCEPTIONS,"THE IDEA THAT U.S. CONSERVATIVES ARE UNIQUELY LIKELY TO HOLD MISPERCEPTIONS IS WIDESPREAD BUT HAS NOT BEEN SYSTEMATICALLY ASSESSED. RESEARCH HAS FOCUSED ON BELIEFS ABOUT NARROW SETS OF CLAIMS NEVER INTENDED TO CAPTURE THE RICHNESS OF THE POLITICAL INFORMATION ENVIRONMENT. FURTHERMORE, FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THIS PERFORMANCE GAP REMAIN UNCLEAR. WE GENERATED AN UNIQUE LONGITUDINAL DATASET COMBINING SOCIAL MEDIA ENGAGEMENT DATA AND A 12-WAVE PANEL STUDY OF AMERICANSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ POLITICAL KNOWLEDGE ABOUT HIGH-PROFILE NEWS OVER 6 MONTHS. RESULTS CONFIRM THAT CONSERVATIVES HAVE LOWER SENSITIVITY THAN LIBERALS, PERFORMING WORSE AT DISTINGUISHING TRUTHS AND FALSEHOODS. THIS IS PARTIALLY EXPLAINED BY THE FACT THAT THE MOST WIDELY SHARED FALSEHOODS TEND TO PROMOTE CONSERVATIVE POSITIONS, WHILE CORRESPONDING TRUTHS TYPICALLY FAVOR LIBERALS. THE PROBLEM IS EXACERBATED BY LIBERALSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ TENDENCY TO EXPERIENCE BIGGER IMPROVEMENTS IN SENSITIVITY THAN CONSERVATIVES AS THE PROPORTION OF PARTISAN NEWS INCREASES.

285,INFODEMIC PATHWAYS EVALUATING THE ROLE THAT TRADITIONAL AND SOCIAL MEDIA PLAY IN CROSSNATIONAL INFORMATION TRANSFER,"THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS OCCURRED ALONGSIDE A WORLDWIDE INFODEMIC WHERE UNPRECEDENTED LEVELS OF MISINFORMATION HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO WIDESPREAD MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT THE NOVEL CORONAVIRUS. CONSPIRACY THEORIES, POORLY SOURCED MEDICAL ADVICE, AND INFORMATION TRIVIALIZING THE VIRUS HAVE IGNORED NATIONAL BORDERS AND SPREAD QUICKLY. THIS INFORMATION SPREAD HAS OCCURRED DESPITE GENERALLY STRONG PREFERENCES FOR DOMESTIC NATIONAL MEDIA AND SOCIAL MEDIA NETWORKS THAT TEND TO BE GEOGRAPHICALLY BOUNDED. HOW, THEN, IS (MIS)INFORMATION CROSSING BORDERS SO RAPIDLY? USING SOCIAL MEDIA AND SURVEY DATA, WE EVALUATE THE EXTENT TO WHICH CONSUMPTION AND PROPAGATION PATTERNS OF DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL TRADITIONAL NEWS AND SOCIAL MEDIA CAN HELP INFORM THEORIZING ABOUT CROSS-NATIONAL INFORMATION SPREAD. IN A DETAILED CASE STUDY OF CANADA, WE EMPLOY A LARGE MULTI-WAVE SURVEY AND A MASSIVE DATA SET OF CANADIAN TWITTER USERS. WE SHOW THAT THE MAJORITY OF MISINFORMATION CIRCULATING ON TWITTER THAT IS SHARED BY CANADIAN ACCOUNTS IS RETWEETED FROM U.S.-BASED ACCOUNTS. MOREOVER, EXPOSURE TO U.S.-BASED MEDIA OUTLETS IS ASSOCIATED WITH COVID-19 MISPERCEPTIONS AND INCREASED EXPOSURE TO U.S.-BASED INFORMATION ON TWITTER IS ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASED LIKELIHOOD TO POST MISINFORMATION.

IN ITALY, ONE OF THE FIRST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES SUFFERING A RISE IN NEW CASES AND DEALING WITH A TOTAL LOCKDOWN, CONTROVERSIAL TOPICS SUCH AS MIGRANT FLOWS AND THE 5G TECHNOLOGY WERE OFTEN ASSOCIATED ONLINE WITH THE ORIGIN AND DIFFUSION OF THE VIRUS. IN THIS WORK WE ANALYZE COVID-19 RELATED CONVERSATIONS ON THE ITALIAN FACEBOOK, COLLECTING OVER 1.5M POSTS SHARED BY NEARLY 80K PUBLIC PAGES AND GROUPS FOR A PERIOD OF FOUR MONTHS SINCE JANUARY 2020. ON THE ONE HAND, OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT WELL-KNOWN UNRELIABLE SOURCES HAD A LIMITED EXPOSURE, AND THAT DISCUSSIONS OVER CONTROVERSIAL TOPICS DID NOT SPARK A COMPARABLE ENGAGEMENT WITH RESPECT TO INSTITUTIONAL AND SCIENTIFIC COMMUNICATION. ON THE OTHER HAND, HOWEVER, WE REALIZE THAT DIS- AND COUNTER-INFORMATION INDUCED A POLARIZATION OF (CLUSTERS OF) GROUPS AND PAGES, WHEREIN CONVERSATIONS WERE CHARACTERIZED BY A TOPICAL LEXICON, BY A GREAT DIFFUSION OF USER GENERATED CONTENT, AND BY LINK-SHARING PATTERNS THAT SEEM ASCRIBABLE TO COORDINATED PROPAGANDA. AS REVEALED BY THE URL-SHARING DIFFUSION NETWORK SHOWING A Ã¢â‚¬Å“SMALL-WORLDÃ¢â‚¬Â EFFECT, USERS WERE EASILY EXPOSED TO HARMFUL PROPAGANDA AS WELL AS TO VERIFIED INFORMATION ON THE VIRUS, EXALTING THE ROLE OF PUBLIC FIGURES AND MAINSTREAM MEDIA, AS WELL AS OF FACEBOOK GROUPS, IN SHAPING THE PUBLIC OPINION.

299,FAKE NEWS IN DERMATOLOGY RESULTS FROM AN OBSERVATIONAL CROSSSECTIONAL STUDY,"BACKGROUND: SOCIAL NETWORKS HAVE BECOME A MEANS FOR DISSEMINATING INFORMATION ON HEALTH-RELATED MATTERS. OBJECTIVE: DESCRIBE THE CHARACTERISTICS AND ANALYZE THE ACCURACY OF THE DERMATOLOGY CONTENT THAT IS MOST OFTEN SHARED ON THE MOST POPULAR SOCIAL NETWORKS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THE CONTENT MOST OFTEN SHARED ON SOCIAL NETWORKS (FACEBOOK, PINTEREST, TWITTER, AND REDDIT) BETWEEN MARCH 2019 AND MARCH 2020 WAS ANALYZED USING THE KEYWORDS: ACNE, ALOPECIA/HAIR LOSS, PSORIASIS, ECZEMA, MELANOMA, SKIN CANCER, RASH, AND ROSACEA. THE TOTAL NUMBER OF INTERACTIONS, SKIN DISEASE, TOPIC, AND ORIGIN WAS COLLECTED FROM EACH OF THE RECORDS. THE CONTENT WAS ANALYZED AND WAS CATEGORIZED AS PRECISE, CONFUSING, OR IMPRECISE BASED ON THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE AVAILABLE. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 385 WEBSITES WERE INCLUDED. ABOUT 44.7% OF THE SHARED CONTENT WAS RATED AS IMPRECISE, 20% AS CONFUSING, AND 35.3% AS PRECISE. THE RECORDS CLASSIFIED AS IMPRECISE OBTAINED A HIGHER MEAN NUMBER OF INTERACTIONS (PÃ‚Â <Ã‚Â 0.05). NO DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND IN TERMS OF THE LEVEL OF CERTAINTY AND THE DERMATOSIS STUDIED, WHEREAS THEY DID EXIST IN RELATION TO THEIR TOPIC AND ORIGIN (PÃ‚Â <Ã‚Â 0.001). OF THE CONTENTS CLASSIFIED AS IMPRECISE, THE MOST FREQUENT TOPIC AND ORIGIN WERE ""ALTERNATIVE MEDICINES"" AND ""INDIVIDUAL OPINIONS, ARTICLES NOT AFFILIATED WITH HEALTH INSTITUTIONS, NOR PEER REVIEWED,"" RESPECTIVELY. CONCLUSIONS: THE MAJORITY OF THE CONTENTS OFTEN SHARED ON SOCIAL NETWORKS ARE BELOW ACCEPTABLE QUALITY STANDARDS.

337,MISCONCEPTIONS MISINFORMATION AND POLITICS OF COVID19 ON SOCIAL MEDIA A MULTILEVEL ANALYSIS IN GHANA,"BACKGROUND: GHANA DEVELOPED AN EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE PLAN (EPRP) IN RESPONSE TO THE SEVERE ACUTE RESPIRATORY SYNDROME CORONAVIRUS (SARS COV-2) PANDEMIC. A KEY STRATEGY IN THE EPRP IS TO MOBILIZE NATIONAL RESOURCES AND PUT IN PLACE STRATEGIES FOR IMPROVED RISK AND BEHAVIORAL CHANGE COMMUNICATION. NONETHELESS, CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED ON SOCIAL MEDIA ABOUT COVID-19 MISINFORMATION AND MISCONCEPTIONS. THIS STUDY USED SOCIAL MEDIA CONTENT TO DETERMINE THE TYPES, FORMS AND THE EFFECTS OF THE MYTHS, MISCONCEPTIONS AND MISINFORMATION IN GHANA'S COVID-19 CONTAINMENT. METHOD: THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN THREE PHASES INVOLVING THE USE OF BOTH PRIMARY AND SECONDARY DATA. REVIEW OF SOCIAL MEDIA INFORMATION ON COVID-19 WAS DONE. THIS WAS COMPLEMENTED WITH DOCUMENT REVIEW AND INTERVIEWS WITH KEY STAKEHOLDERS WITH EXPERTISE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES AND MASS COMMUNICATION EXPERTS (N = 18). ALL INTERVIEWS WERE TRANSCRIBED VERBATIM AND ANALYZED USING NVIVO 12. RESULTS: THE STUDY SHOWED A CHANGING PATTERN IN THE MISCONCEPTIONS AND MISINFORMATION ABOUT COVID-19. INITIALLY MYTHS WERE LARGELY ON CAUSES AND VULNERABILITY. IT WAS WIDELY SPECULATED THAT BLACK PEOPLE HAD SOME IMMUNITY AGAINST COVID-19. ALSO, THE CONDITION WAS PERCEIVED TO CAUSE SEVERE DISEASE AMONG THE ELDERLY. THESE MISCONCEPTIONS SERVED AS RISK ATTENUATORS AMONG GHANAIANS, ESPECIALLY THE YOUNGER GENERATION. AS THE INFECTION EVOLVED IN THE COUNTRY, ANOTHER MISCONCEPTION EMERGED THAT THE HOT CLIMATE IN AFRICA INHIBITED VIRAL REPLICATION AND TRANSMISSION ONLY TO BE FOLLOWED BY SPECULATIONS AND CONJECTURES THAT COVID-19 WAS BEING USED AS A BIOLOGICAL WEAPON TO TARGET DEVELOPED ECONOMICS. FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF COVID-19, THE USE OF LOCAL REMEDIES SUCH AS NEEM TREE (AZADIRACHTA INDICA) AND HERBAL PREPARATION ALSO EMERGED. MYTHS ABOUT THE EFFICACY OF LOCALLY MANUFACTURED GIN (AKPETESHIE) AND HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE AS PROPHYLAXIS LED TO ABUSE OF SUCH SUBSTANCES. INTERVIEW SEGMENTS REVEALED THE USE OF MYTHS TO PROPAGATE POLITICAL AGENDA IN THE COUNTRY. CONCLUSION: THE STUDY CONCLUDES THAT COVID-19 MISCONCEPTIONS AND MISINFORMATION ARE WIDESPREAD AND COVER THE COURSE OF THE CONDITION. THESE MYTHS NECESSITATE CULTURALLY SENSITIVE HEALTH COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES THAT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT LOCAL PERCEPTIONS OF COVID-19 IN ORDER TO TACKLE THE CIRCULATION OF MISCONCEIVED MESSAGES ABOUT THE PANDEMIC IN GHANA.

HOWEVER, EVERYONE WITH A TWITTER ACCOUNT WAS NOT EQUALLY QUALIFIED TO SPEAK KNOWLEDGEABLY ABOUT CRITICAL ISSUES RELATED TO THE OUTBREAK, SUCH AS PREVENTION AND TREATMENT. AND, ACCURATE INFORMATION FROM INFORMED SOURCES CAN MEAN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH. OUR EXPLORATORY STUDY ADDRESSES A SIMPLE, BUT IMPORTANT QUESTION: WHOSE MESSAGES ABOUT THE EFFICACY OF HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE AS A TREATMENT FOR CORONAVIRUS WERE GETTING THE MOST ATTENTION ON TWITTER? WE PROVIDE A DATA VISUALIZATION OF TWITTER ACTIVITY FOR THE PERIOD OF 21 JANUARY THROUGH 21 MAY 2020 THAT SHOWS USERS WHO TWEETED ABOUT HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE, AS WELL AS WHO INTERACTED WITH EACH OF THEM (THROUGH LIKES, COMMENTS, RETWEETS, ETC.) TO DETERMINE WHO WERE THE MOST PROMINENT VOICES ON THE NETWORK DURING A CRITICAL JUNCTURE OF THE OUTBREAK. FROM OUR ANALYSIS, IT APPEARS THAT PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMPÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S HANDLE (@REALDONALDTRUMP) AND OTHER PRO-TRUMP RELATED ACCOUNTS WERE THE MOST INFLUENTIAL VOICES ON TWITTER DURING THIS TIME OF THE CRISIS, RATHER THAN THOSE FROM RELEVANT EXPERTS, SUCH AS THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION (@CDCGOV) OR THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES (@NIAIDNEWS).

THE RESULTS SHOW THAT FAKE NEWS SHARED ON SOCIAL MEDIA HAS SIX MAJOR THEMES: HEALTH, RELIGION, POLITICS, CRIME, ENTERTAINMENT, AND MISCELLANEOUS; EIGHT TYPES OF CONTENT: TEXT, PHOTO, AUDIO, AND VIDEO, TEXT & PHOTO, TEXT & VIDEO, PHOTO & VIDEO, AND TEXT & PHOTO & VIDEO; AND TWO MAIN SOURCES: ONLINE SOURCES AND THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA. HEALTH-RELATED FAKE NEWS IS MORE COMMON ONLY DURING A HEALTH CRISIS, WHEREAS FAKE NEWS RELATED TO RELIGION AND POLITICS SEEMS MORE PREVALENT, EMERGING FROM ONLINE MEDIA. TEXT & PHOTO AND TEXT & VIDEO HAVE THREE-FOURTHS OF THE TOTAL SHARE OF FAKE NEWS, AND MOST OF THEM ARE FROM ONLINE MEDIA: ONLINE MEDIA IS THE MAIN SOURCE OF FAKE NEWS ON SOCIAL MEDIA AS WELL. ON THE OTHER HAND, MAINSTREAM MEDIA MOSTLY PRODUCES POLITICAL FAKE NEWS. THIS STUDY, PRESENTING SOME NOVEL FINDINGS THAT MAY HELP RESEARCHERS TO UNDERSTAND AND POLICYMAKERS TO CONTROL FAKE NEWS ON SOCIAL MEDIA, INVITES MORE ACADEMIC INVESTIGATIONS OF RELIGIOUS AND POLITICAL FAKE NEWS IN INDIA.

MOREOVER, WHETHER FACT CHECKING IS EFFECTIVE IN PREVENTING CITIZENS FROM FALLING FOR FAKE NEWS, PARTICULARLY COVID-19 RELATED, IS UNCLEAR. AGAINST THIS BACKDROP, WE EXAMINE POTENTIAL ANTECEDENTS TO FACT CHECKING THAT CAN BE A TARGET FOR INTERVENTIONS AND ESTABLISH THAT FACT CHECKING IS ACTUALLY EFFECTIVE FOR PREVENTING THE PUBLIC FROM FALLING FOR HARMFUL COVID-19 FAKE NEWS. WE USE A REPRESENTATIVE U.S. SAMPLE COLLECTED IN APRIL OF 2020 AND FIND THAT AWARENESS OF FAKE NEWS AND PATTERNS OF ACTIVE SM USE (E.G., COMMENTING ON CONTENT INSTEAD OF READING IT) INCREASES THE FACT CHECKING OF COVID-19 FAKE NEWS, WHEREAS SM HOMOPHILY REDUCES FACT CHECKING AND THE EFFECTS OF SM USE AS USERS ARE TRAPPED IN Ã¢â‚¬Å“ECHO CHAMBERSÃ¢â‚¬Â. WE ALSO FIND THAT FACT CHECKING HELPS USERS IDENTIFY ACCURATE INFORMATION ON HOW TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AGAINST COVID-19 INSTEAD OF FALSE AND OFTEN HARMFUL CLAIMS PROPAGATED ON SM.

UNDERSTANDING THE CHARACTERISTICS OF HEALTH MISINFORMATION CAN BE A PREMISE FOR REBUKING AND PURPOSEFULLY CORRECTING SUCH MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA. METHODS: USING SAMPLES OF CHINAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA RELATED TO THE COVID19 OUTBREAK (N=547), THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS ARTICLE WAS TO ILLUSTRATE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF SAID MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA IN CHINA BY DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS, INCLUDING THE TYPOLOGY, THE MOST-MENTIONED INFORMATION, AND A DEVELOPMENTAL TIMELINE. RESULTS: THE RESULTS REVEAL THAT MISINFORMATION RELATED TO PREVENTIVE AND THERAPEUTIC METHODS IS THE MOST-MENTIONED TYPE. OTHER TYPES OF MISINFORMATION ASSOCIATED WITH PEOPLEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S DAILY LIVES ARE ALSO WIDESPREAD. MOREOVER, CULTURAL AND SOCIAL BELIEFS HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE PERCEPTION AND PROPAGANDA OF MISINFORMATION, AND CHANGES IN THE CRISIS SITUATION ARE RELEVANT TO THE TYPE VARIANCE OF MISINFORMATION. CONCLUSION: FOLLOWING RESEARCH RESULTS, STRATEGIES OF HEALTH COMMUNICATION FOR MANAGING MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA ARE GIVEN, SUCH AS CREDIBLE SOURCES AND EXPERT SOURCES. ALSO, TRADITIONAL BELIEFS OR PERCEPTIONS PLAY THE VITAL ROLE IN HEALTH COMMUNICATION. TO SUM UP, COMBATING MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA IS LIKELY NOT A SINGLE EFFORT TO CORRECT MISINFORMATION OR TO PREVENT ITS SPREAD.

AFTER CONTROLLING FOR GENDER, AGE, EDUCATION AND INCOME, WE FOUND THAT WHATSAPP USE, PARTY IDENTIFICATION AND TRUST IN NEWS ARE POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONCERN FOR MISINFORMATION. SIMILARLY, PARTISANS ARE MORE LIKELY TO ENGAGE WITH NEWS ONLINE. WHILE FACEBOOK AND TWITTER USE ARE POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH ONLINE NEWS SHARING, THE USE OF WHATSAPP IS NOT SIGNIFICANT.

413,DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS INFLUENCING THE IMPACT OF CORONAVIRUSRELATED MISINFORMATION ON WHATSAPP CROSSSECTIONAL QUESTIONNAIRE STUDY,"BACKGROUND: THE RISKS OF MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES IS A GLOBAL ISSUE, ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE COVID-19 INFODEMIC. WHATSAPP IS BEING USED AS AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF COVID-19-RELATED INFORMATION DURING THE CURRENT PANDEMIC. UNLIKE FACEBOOK AND TWITTER, LIMITED STUDIES HAVE INVESTIGATED THE ROLE OF WHATSAPP AS A SOURCE OF COMMUNICATION, INFORMATION, OR MISINFORMATION DURING CRISIS SITUATIONS. OBJECTIVE: OUR STUDY AIMED TO EVALUATE THE VULNERABILITY OF DEMOGRAPHIC COHORTS IN A DEVELOPING COUNTRY TOWARD COVID-19-RELATED MISINFORMATION SHARED VIA WHATSAPP. WE ALSO AIMED TO IDENTIFY CHARACTERISTICS OF WHATSAPP MESSAGES ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED CREDIBILITY OF MISINFORMATION. METHODS: WE CONDUCTED A WEB-BASED QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY AND DESIGNED A SCORING SYSTEM BASED ON THEORIES SUPPORTED BY THE EXISTING LITERATURE. VULNERABILITY (K) WAS MEASURED AS A RATIO OF THE RESPONDENT'S SCORE TO THE MAXIMUM SCORE. RESPONDENTS WERE STRATIFIED ACCORDING TO AGE AND OCCUPATION, AND KMEAN WAS CALCULATED AND COMPARED AMONG EACH SUBGROUP USING SINGLE-FACTOR ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE AND HOCHBERG GT2 TESTS. THE QUESTIONNAIRE EVALUATED THE RESPONDENTS' OPINION OF THE VERACITY OF CORONAVIRUS-RELATED WHATSAPP MESSAGES. THE RESPONSES TO THE FALSE-PROVEN MESSAGES WERE COMPARED USING Z TEST BETWEEN THE 2 GROUPS: CORONAVIRUS-RELATED WHATSAPP MESSAGES WITH AN ATTACHED LINK AND/OR SOURCE AND THOSE WITHOUT. RESULTS: WE ANALYZED 1137 RESPONSES FROM WHATSAPP USERS IN INDIA. USERS AGED OVER 65 YEARS HAD THE HIGHEST VULNERABILITY (KMEAN=0.38, 95% CI 0.341-0.419) TO MISINFORMATION. RESPONDENTS IN THE AGE GROUP 19-25 YEARS HAD SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER VULNERABILITY (KMEAN=0.31, 95% CI 0.301-0.319) THAN THOSE AGED OVER 25 YEARS (P&LT;.05). THE VULNERABILITY OF USERS EMPLOYED IN ELEMENTARY OCCUPATIONS WAS THE HIGHEST (KMEAN=0.38, 95% CI 0.356-0.404), AND IT WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THAT OF PROFESSIONALS AND STUDENTS (P&LT;.05). INTERESTINGLY, THE VULNERABILITY OF HEALTHCARE WORKERS WAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF OTHER OCCUPATION GROUPS (P&GT;.05). WE FOUND THAT FALSE CRWMS WITH AN ATTACHED LINK AND/OR SOURCE WERE MARKED TRUE 6 TIMES MORE OFTEN THAN FALSE CRWMS WITHOUT AN ATTACHED LINK OR SOURCE (P&LT;.001). CONCLUSIONS: OUR STUDY DEMONSTRATES THAT IN A DEVELOPING COUNTRY, WHATSAPP USERS AGED OVER 65 YEARS AND THOSE INVOLVED IN ELEMENTARY OCCUPATIONS WERE FOUND TO BE THE MOST VULNERABLE TO FALSE INFORMATION DISSEMINATED VIA WHATSAPP. HEALTH CARE WORKERS, WHO ARE OTHERWISE CONSIDERED AS EXPERTS WITH REGARD TO THIS GLOBAL HEALTH CARE CRISIS, ALSO SHARED THIS VULNERABILITY TO MISINFORMATION WITH OTHER OCCUPATION GROUPS. OUR FINDINGS ALSO INDICATED THAT THE PRESENCE OF AN ATTACHED LINK AND/OR SOURCE FALSELY VALIDATING AN INCORRECT MESSAGE ADDS SIGNIFICANT FALSE CREDIBILITY, MAKING IT APPEAR TRUE. THESE RESULTS INDICATE AN EMERGENT NEED TO ADDRESS AND RECTIFY THE CURRENT USAGE PATTERNS OF WHATSAPP USERS. THIS STUDY ALSO PROVIDES METRICS THAT CAN BE USED BY HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATIONS AND GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES TO FORMULATE GUIDELINES TO CONTAIN THE SPREAD OF WHATSAPP-RELATED MISINFORMATION.

DURING FIELDWORK IN VELES, WHERE WE INTERVIEWED SEVERAL RESIDENTS AND DISINFORMATION CREATORS, WE FOUND THAT THE EPICENTER OF THIS VIRAL PHENOMENON WAS MIRKO CESELKOSKI, AN AUTODIDACT SOCIAL MEDIA EXPERT, TEACHER, AND MENTOR TO VELES' FAKE NEWS OPERATORS. WE INTERVIEWED CESELKOSKI AND REGISTERED AND ATTENDED HIS ONLINE COURSE-THE SAME COURSE NUMEROUS VELES RESIDENTS TOOK OFFLINE. OUR RESEARCH CONFIRMS (1) THE PIVOTAL ROLE CESELKOSKI HAD IN THE CREATION OF THIS INDUSTRY; (2) THE ECONOMIC MOTIVATION DRIVING THE FAKE NEWS DISSEMINATORS; AND (3) THE MANNER IN WHICH THE MOSTLY YOUNG PEOPLE IN THEIR EARLY TWENTIES WITH LITTLE ENGLISH FLUENCY WERE ABLE TO GENERATE SO MUCH TRAFFIC AND DISSEMINATE SO MUCH DISINFORMATION.

430,MECHANICS OF RUMOR MILLS AND EPISTEMIC MOTIVATIONAL PROCESSES OF FOODRELATED RUMOR SPREAD INTERPLAY BETWEEN ATTITUDE AND ISSUE MOTIVATION,"THIS STUDY TESTED THE MANNER IN WHICH ATTITUDE TOWARD AN OBJECT OF RUMOR AFFECTS PEOPLEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S EPISTEMIC MOTIVATION TO SOLVE A PROBLEM AND TO SHARE A RUMOR, SPECIFICALLY ON SOCIAL MEDIA, USING TWO RUMORS REGARDING FOOD SAFETY ISSUES INCLUDING MCDONALDÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S AND GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOOD. AN ONLINE SURVEY ADMINISTERED TO 184 UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS WHO USE TWITTER SHOWED THAT NEGATIVE ATTITUDES INCREASED THE LIKELIHOOD OF RUMOR SHARING, MEDIATED BY ISSUE-RELATED EPISTEMIC MOTIVATION. HOWEVER, POSITIVE ATTITUDES SHOWED NO EFFECTS ON ISSUE-RELATED MOTIVATION AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF RUMOR SHARING. THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS ARE DISCUSSED.

202,A VALUEDRIVEN APPROACH TO ADDRESSING MISINFORMATION IN SOCIAL MEDIA,"MISINFORMATION IN SOCIAL MEDIA IS AN ACTUAL AND CONTESTED POLICY PROBLEM GIVEN ITS OUTREACH AND THE VARIETY OF STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED. IN PARTICULAR, INCREASED SOCIAL MEDIA USE MAKES THE SPREAD OF MISINFORMATION ALMOST UNIVERSAL. HERE WE DEMONSTRATE A FRAMEWORK FOR EVALUATING TOOLS FOR DETECTING MISINFORMATION USING A PREFERENCE ELICITATION APPROACH, AS WELL AS AN INTEGRATED DECISION ANALYTIC PROCESS FOR EVALUATING DESIRABLE FEATURES OF SYSTEMS FOR COMBATTING MISINFORMATION. THE FRAMEWORK WAS TESTED IN THREE COUNTRIES (AUSTRIA, GREECE, AND SWEDEN) WITH THREE GROUPS OF STAKEHOLDERS (POLICYMAKERS, JOURNALISTS, AND CITIZENS). MULTI-CRITERIA DECISION ANALYSIS WAS THE METHODOLOGICAL BASIS FOR THE RESEARCH. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT PARTICIPANTS PRIORITISED INFORMATION REGARDING THE ACTORS BEHIND THE DISTRIBUTION OF MISINFORMATION AND TRACING THE LIFE CYCLE OF MISINFORMATIVE POSTS. ANOTHER IMPORTANT CRITERION WAS WHETHER SOMEONE INTENDED TO DELUDE OTHERS, WHICH SHOWS A PREFERENCE FOR TRUST, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND QUALITY IN, FOR INSTANCE, JOURNALISM. ALSO, HOW MISINFORMATION TRAVELS IS IMPORTANT. HOWEVER, ALL CRITERIA THAT INVOLVED ACTIVE CONTRIBUTIONS TO DEALING WITH MISINFORMATION WERE RANKED LOW IN IMPORTANCE, WHICH SHOWS THAT PARTICIPANTS MAY NOT HAVE FELT PERSONALLY INVOLVED ENOUGH IN THE SUBJECT OR SITUATION. THE RESULTS ALSO SHOW DIFFERENCES IN PREFERENCES FOR TOOLS THAT ARE INFLUENCED BY CULTURAL BACKGROUND AND THAT MIGHT BE CONSIDERED IN THE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF TOOLS.

211,AN ANALYSIS OF ASTRAZENECA COVID19 VACCINE MISINFORMATION AND FEAR MONGERING ON TWITTER,"OBJECTIVES: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ANALYSE THE MEDIA DISCOURSE ABOUT THE ASTRAZENECA COVID-19 VACCINE ON TWITTER. STUDY DESIGN: THE STUDY DESIGN USED IN THIS STUDY IS DATA SCRAPING, MEDIA ANALYSIS, SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS, AND BOTOMETER. METHODS: WE COLLECTED 221,922 TWEETS CONTAINING Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ#ASTRAZENECAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ FROM 1 JANUARY 2021 TO 22 MARCH 2021. FROM 50,080 TWEETS IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE, WE ANALYSED THE LINKED MEDIA SOURCES AND CONDUCTED A NETWORK DETECTION STUDY. RESULTS: WE FOUND THAT THE MOST FREQUENTLY RETWEETED TWEETS WERE FULL OF NEGATIVE INFORMATION, AND IN MANY CASES CAME FROM MEDIA SOURCES THAT ARE WELL-KNOWN FOR MISINFORMATION. OUR ANALYSIS IDENTIFIED LARGE COORDINATION NETWORKS INVOLVED IN POLITICAL ASTROTURFING AND VACCINE DIPLOMACY IN SOUTH ASIA BUT ALSO VACCINE ADVOCACY NETWORKS ASSOCIATED WITH EUROPEAN COMMISSION EMPLOYEES. CONCLUSIONS: THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY SHOW THAT TWITTER DISCOURSE ABOUT #ASTRAZENECA IS FILLED WITH MISINFORMATION AND BAD PRESS, AND MAY BE DISTRIBUTED NOT ONLY ORGANICALLY BY ANTI-VAXXER ACTIVISTS BUT ALSO SYSTEMATICALLY BY PROFESSIONAL SOURCES.

213,DEMOGRAPHICS AND TOPICS IMPACT ON THE COSPREAD OF COVID19 MISINFORMATION AND FACTCHECKS ON TWITTER,"CORRECTING MISCONCEPTIONS AND FALSE BELIEFS ARE IMPORTANT FOR INJECTING RELIABLE INFORMATION ABOUT COVID-19 INTO PUBLIC DISCOURSE, BUT WHAT IMPACT DOES THIS HAVE ON THE CONTINUED PROLIFERATION OF MISINFORMING CLAIMS? FACT-CHECKING ORGANISATIONS PRODUCE CONTENT WITH THE AIM OF REDUCING MISINFORMATION SPREAD, BUT OUR KNOWLEDGE OF ITS IMPACT ON MISINFORMATION FOR PARTICULAR TOPICS AND DEMOGRAPHICS IS LIMITED. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE EXPLORE THE RELATION BETWEEN MISINFORMATION AND FACT-CHECKING SPREAD DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC FOR DIFFERENT TOPICS, USER DEMOGRAPHICS AND ATTRIBUTES. WE SPECIFICALLY FOLLOW MISINFORMATION AND FACT-CHECKS EMERGING FROM DECEMBER 2019 UNTIL THE 4TH OF JANUARY 2021 ON TWITTER. USING A COMBINATION OF SPREAD VARIANCE ANALYSIS, IMPULSE RESPONSE MODELLING AND CAUSAL ANALYSIS, WE HIGHLIGHT THE BIDIRECTIONAL, WEAK CAUSATION SPREAD BEHAVIOUR BETWEEN MISINFORMATION AND FACT-CHECKS. ALTHOUGH WE OBSERVE THAT FACT-CHECKS ABOUT COVID-19 ARE APPEARING FAIRLY QUICKLY AFTER MISINFORMATION IS CIRCULATED, ITS ABILITY TO REDUCE OVERALL MISINFORMATION SPREAD APPEARS TO BE LIMITED. THIS IS ESPECIALLY VISIBLE FOR MISINFORMATION ABOUT CONSPIRACY THEORIES AND THE CAUSES OF THE VIRUS.

214,LINGUISTIC CHARACTERISTICS AND THE DISSEMINATION OF MISINFORMATION IN SOCIAL MEDIA THE MODERATING EFFECT OF INFORMATION RICHNESS,"IN RECENT YEARS, THERE HAS BEEN A RISE IN INCORRECT INFORMATION, OR MISINFORMATION, BEING SHARED ON SOCIAL MEDIA. SUCH MISINFORMATION TENDS TO BE MORE EYE-CATCHING AND MISLEADING. PREVIOUS STUDIES ON DETECTING MISINFORMATION ONLINE HAVE FOCUSED MAINLY ON LINGUISTIC CHARACTERISTICS; HOWEVER, THE ROLE OF LINGUISTIC CHARACTERISTICS IN MISINFORMATION DISSEMINATION HAS NOT YET BEEN THOROUGHLY RESEARCHED. IN THIS STUDY, WE PROPOSE A MISINFORMATION DISSEMINATION MODEL THAT INCLUDES THE DIRECT EFFECTS OF FOUR NOVEL LINGUISTIC CHARACTERISTICS ON DISSEMINATION AND THE MODERATING EFFECT OF INFORMATION RICHNESS. THE MODEL IS TESTED BY USING 9,631 EXAMPLES OF MISINFORMATION COLLECTED FROM SINA-WEIBO, THE LEADING SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM IN CHINA. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT COMPARED WITH CORRECT INFORMATION, MISINFORMATION CONTAINING PERSUASIVE AND UNCERTAINTY WORDS IS MORE LIKELY TO BE DISSEMINATED THAN MISINFORMATION CONTAINING EMOTIONAL AND COMPARATIVE WORDS. FURTHERMORE, IN THE CASE OF INFORMATION RICHNESS, THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT WHEN THE MISINFORMATION INCLUDES IMAGES, THE EFFECTS OF PERSUASIVE, NEGATIVE EMOTION, COMPARATIVE, AND UNCERTAINTY WORDS ARE STRENGTHENED, WHILE THE INCLUSION OF VIDEOS WEAKENS THE EFFECTS OF THE LINGUISTIC CHARACTERISTICS. FINALLY, THE RESULTS OF ROBUSTNESS CHECK BY USING THE FAKENEWSNET DATA SET ARE CONSISTENT WITH OUR HYPOTHESIS, INDICATING THAT THE FOUR LINGUISTIC CHARACTERISTICS PROPOSED BY THIS STUDY ARE ALSO SUITABLE FOR THE DISSEMINATION OF MISINFORMATION IN ENGLISH. THE ROBUSTNESS CHECK FURTHER DEMONSTRATES OUR METHOD WITH WELL GENERALIZATION.

223,A RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS OF THE COVID19 INFODEMIC IN SAUDI ARABIA,"COVID-19 HAS HAD BROAD DISRUPTIVE EFFECTS ON ECONOMIES, HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS, GOVERNMENTS, SOCIETIES, AND INDIVIDUALS. UNCERTAINTY CONCERNING THE SCALE OF THIS CRISIS HAS GIVEN RISE TO COUNTLESS RUMORS, HOAXES, AND MISINFORMATION. MUCH OF THIS TYPE OF CONVERSATION AND MISINFORMATION ABOUT THE PANDEMIC NOW OCCURS ONLINE AND IN PARTICULAR ON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS LIKE TWITTER. THIS STUDY ANALYSIS INCORPORATED A DATA-DRIVEN APPROACH TO MAP THE CONTOURS OF MISINFORMATION AND CONTEXTUALIZE THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC WITH REGARDS TO SOCIO-RELIGIOUS-POLITICAL INFORMATION. THIS WORK CONSISTS OF A COMBINED SYSTEM BRIDGING QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE METHODOLOGIES TO ASSESS HOW INFORMATION-EXCHANGING BEHAVIORS CAN BE USED TO MINIMIZE THE EFFECTS OF EMERGENT MISINFORMATION. THE STUDY REVEALED THAT THE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS DETECTED THE MOST SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF RUMORS IN TRANSMITTING INFORMATION RAPIDLY IN THE COMMUNITY. IT SHOWED THAT WHATSAPP USERS MADE UP ABOUT 46% OF THE SOURCE OF RUMORS IN ONLINE PLATFORMS, WHILE, THROUGH TWITTER, IT DEMONSTRATED A DECLINING TREND OF RUMORS BY 41%. MOREOVER, THE RESULTS INDICATE THE SECOND-MOST COMMON TYPE OF MISINFORMATION WAS PROVIDED BY PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES; HOWEVER, A PREVALENT TYPE OF MISINFORMATION SPREADING IN THE WORLD DURING THIS PANDEMIC HAS TO DO WITH THE BIOLOGICAL WAR. IN THIS COMBINED RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS OF THE STUDY, SOCIAL MEDIA WITH VARYING APPROACHES IN PUBLIC DISCOURSE CONTRIBUTES TO EFFICIENT PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSES. Ã‚Â© 2021 BY THE AUTHORS.

225,SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF RUMOR SPREAD AMID COVID19 BASED ON WEIBO TEXT,"(1) BACKGROUND: IN EARLY 2020, COVID-19 BROKE OUT. DRIVEN BY PEOPLEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S PSYCHOLOGY OF CONFORMITY, PANIC, GROUP POLARIZATION, ETC., VARIOUS RUMORS APPEARED AND SPREAD WILDLY, AND THE INTERNET BECAME A HOTBED OF RUMORS. (2) METHODS: THE STUDY SELECTED WEIBO AS THE RESEARCH MEDIA, USING TOPIC MODELS, TIME SERIES ANALYSIS, SENTIMENT ANALYSIS, AND GRANGER CAUSALITY TESTING METHODS TO ANALYZE THE SOCIAL MEDIA TEXTS RELATED TO COVID-19 RUMORS. (3) RESULTS: IN STUDY 1, WE OBTAINED 21 TOPICS RELATED TO Ã¢â‚¬Å“COVID-19 RUMORSÃ¢â‚¬Â AND Ã¢â‚¬Å“OUTBREAK RUMORSÃ¢â‚¬Â AFTER CONDUCTING TOPIC MODEL ANALYSIS ON WEIBO TEXTS; IN STUDY 2, WE EXPLORED THE EMOTIONAL CHANGES OF NETIZENS BEFORE AND AFTER RUMOR DISPELLING INFORMATION WAS RELEASED AND FOUND PEOPLEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S POSITIVE EMOTIONS FIRST DECLINED AND THEN ROSE; IN STUDY 3, WE ALSO EXPLORED THE EMOTIONAL CHANGES OF NETIZENS BEFORE AND AFTER THE Ã¢â‚¬Å“WU-HAN LOCKDOWNÃ¢â‚¬Â EVENT AND FOUND POSITIVE SENTIMENT OF PEOPLE IN NON-WUHAN AREAS INCREASED, WHILE NEGATIVE SENTIMENT OF PEOPLE IN WUHAN INCREASED; IN STUDY 4, WE STUDIED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RUMOR SPREAD AND EMOTIONAL POLARITY AND FOUND NEGATIVE SENTIMENT AND RUMOR SPREAD WAS CAUSALLY INTERRELATED. (4) CONCLUSION: THESE FINDINGS COULD HELP US TO INTUITIVELY UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT OF RUMORS SPREAD ON PEOPLEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S EMOTIONS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND HELP THE GOVERNMENT TAKE MEASURES TO REDUCE PANIC.

235,EFFECTS OF BRIEF EXPOSURE TO MISINFORMATION ABOUT ECIGARETTE HARMS ON TWITTER A RANDOMISED CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT,"OBJECTIVES TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF EXPOSURE TO MISINFORMATION ABOUT E-CIGARETTE HARMS FOUND ON TWITTER ON ADULT CURRENT SMOKERS' INTENTION TO QUIT SMOKING CIGARETTES, INTENTION TO PURCHASE E-CIGARETTES AND PERCEIVED RELATIVE HARM OF E-CIGARETTES COMPARED WITH REGULAR CIGARETTES. SETTING AN ONLINE RANDOMISED CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT CONDUCTED IN NOVEMBER 2019 AMONG USA AND UK CURRENT SMOKERS. PARTICIPANTS 2400 ADULT CURRENT SMOKERS AGED =18 YEARS WHO WERE NOT CURRENT E-CIGARETTE USERS RECRUITED FROM AN ONLINE PANEL. PARTICIPANTS' WERE RANDOMISED IN A 1:1:1:1 RATIO USING A LEAST-FILL RANDOMISER FUNCTION. INTERVENTIONS VIEWING 4 TWEETS IN RANDOM ORDER WITHIN ONE OF FOUR CONDITIONS: (1) E-CIGARETTES ARE JUST AS OR MORE HARMFUL THAN SMOKING, (2) E-CIGARETTES ARE COMPLETELY HARMLESS, (3) E-CIGARETTE HARMS ARE UNCERTAIN, AND (4) A CONTROL CONDITION OF TWEETS ABOUT PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. PRIMARY OUTCOMES MEASURES SELF-REPORTED POST-TEST INTENTION TO QUIT SMOKING CIGARETTES, INTENTION TO PURCHASE E-CIGARETTES, AND PERCEIVED RELATIVE HARM OF E-CIGARETTES COMPARED WITH SMOKING. RESULTS AMONG US AND UK PARTICIPANTS, AFTER CONTROLLING FOR BASELINE MEASURES OF THE OUTCOME, EXPOSURE TO TWEETS THAT E-CIGARETTES ARE AS OR MORE HARMFUL THAN SMOKING VERSUS CONTROL WAS ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER POST-TEST INTENTION TO PURCHASE E-CIGARETTES (<U+0392>=-0.339, 95% CI -0.487 TO -0.191, P<0.001) AND INCREASED POST-TEST PERCEIVED RELATIVE HARM OF E-CIGARETTES (<U+0392>=0.341, 95% CI 0.273 TO 0.410, P<0.001). AMONG US SMOKERS, EXPOSURE TO TWEETS THAT E-CIGARETTES ARE COMPLETELY HARMLESS WAS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER POST-TEST INTENTION TO PURCHASE E-CIGARETTES (<U+0392>=0.229, 95% CI 0.002 TO 0.456, P=0.048) AND LOWER POST-TEST PERCEIVED RELATIVE HARM OF E-CIGARETTES (<U+0392>=-0.154, 95% CI -0.258 TO -0.050, P=0.004). CONCLUSIONS US AND UK ADULT CURRENT SMOKERS MAY BE DETERRED FROM CONSIDERING USING E-CIGARETTES AFTER BRIEF EXPOSURE TO TWEETS THAT E-CIGARETTES WERE JUST AS OR MORE HARMFUL THAN SMOKING. CONVERSELY, US ADULT CURRENT SMOKERS MAY BE ENCOURAGED TO USE E-CIGARETTES AFTER EXPOSURE TO TWEETS THAT E-CIGARETTES ARE COMPLETELY HARMLESS. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT MISINFORMATION ABOUT E-CIGARETTE HARMS MAY INFLUENCE SOME ADULT SMOKERS' DECISIONS TO CONSIDER USING E-CIGARETTES. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER ISRCTN16082420.

240,PERSUASION STRATEGIES OF MISINFORMATIONCONTAINING POSTS IN THE SOCIAL MEDIA,"SOCIAL MEDIA USERS WERE FOUND TO BE PERSUADED BY MISINFORMATION AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE PROPAGATION OF MISINFORMATION. IT IS IMPORTANT AND URGENT TO UNDERSTAND THE MECHANISMS BEHIND THE PRESENTATION AND DIFFUSION OF MISINFORMATION-CONTAINING POSTS IN SOCIAL MEDIA. HOWEVER, MAJORITY OF PREVIOUS STUDIES ON ONLINE MISINFORMATION FOCUSED ON THE NON-CONTENT OR SURFACE-LINGUISTIC FEATURES, WHICH OMITTED THE INTRINSICALLY SOCIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FEATURES BEHIND THE PRESENTATION OF ONLINE MISINFORMATION. BASED ON PERSUASION THEORIES, THIS STUDY CHARACTERIZES THE USAGE OF PERSUASION STRATEGIES AND ITS INFLUENCE ON THE PROPAGATION OF MISINFORMATION-CONTAINING POSTS IN SINA WEIBO, WHICH CAN HELP US BETTER UNDERSTAND THE SOCIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL MECHANISM BEHIND THE PRESENTATION AND DIFFUSION OF ONLINE MISINFORMATION. THE FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY INDICATE THAT THE PATHOS STRATEGIES ARE THE MOST COMMON ACTS OF PERSUASION IN MISINFORMATION-CONTAINING POSTS IN CONTRAST TO REGULAR POSTS. IN ADDITION, THE TYPE OF PERSUASION STRATEGIES USED IN THE MISINFORMATION-CONTAINING POSTS CORRELATE WITH THE TOPICS, EXPECTED ACTIONS AND DIGITAL ELEMENTS OF THE POSTS. FURTHERMORE, WE FOUND STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS OF PERSUASION STRATEGIESON USERSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ RESPONSES TO MISINFORMATION-CONTAINING POSTS.

TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE, THIS STUDY EXPLORES MISINFORMATION AND ITS RELATED CONCEPTS: DISINFORMATION, FAKE NEWS, AND PROPAGANDA IN FINNISH LANGUAGE TWEETS. WE UTILIZED (1) WORD CLOUD CLUSTERING, (2) TOPIC MODELING, AND (3) WORD COUNT ANALYSIS AND CLUSTERING TO DETECT AND ANALYZE MISINFORMATION-RELATED CONCEPTS AND THEMES CONNECTED TO THOSE CONCEPTS IN FINNISH LANGUAGE TWITTER DISCUSSIONS. OUR RESULTS ARE TWO-FOLD: (1) THOSE CONCERNING THE FUNCTIONAL DATA ANALYSIS METHODS AND (2) THOSE ABOUT THE THEMES CONNECTED IN DISCOURSE TO THE MISINFORMATION-RELATED CONCEPTS. WE NOTICED THAT EACH UTILIZED METHOD INDIVIDUALLY HAS CRITICAL LIMITATIONS, ESPECIALLY ALL THE AUTOMATED ANALYSIS METHODS PROCESSING FOR THE FINNISH LANGUAGE, YET WHEN COMBINED THEY BRING VALUE TO THE ANALYSIS.

256,DEVELOPMENT OF THE 12ITEM SOCIAL MEDIA DISINFORMATION SCALE AND ITS ASSOCIATION WITH SOCIAL MEDIA ADDICTION AND MENTAL HEALTH RELATED TO COVID19 IN TUNISIA SURVEYBASED PILOT CASE STUDY,"BACKGROUND: IN RECENT YEARS, ONLINE DISINFORMATION HAS INCREASED. FAKE NEWS HAS BEEN SPREADING ABOUT THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. SINCE JANUARY 2020, THE CULPRITS AND ANTIDOTES TO DISINFORMATION HAVE BEEN DIGITAL MEDIA AND SOCIAL MEDIA. OBJECTIVE: OUR STUDY AIMED TO DEVELOP AND TEST THE PSYCHOMETRIC PROPERTIES OF THE 12-ITEM SOCIAL MEDIA DISINFORMATION SCALE (SMDS-12), WHICH ASSESSES THE CONSUMPTION, CONFIDENCE, AND SHARING OF INFORMATION RELATED TO COVID-19 BY SOCIAL MEDIA USERS. METHODS: A TOTAL OF 874 SUBJECTS WERE RECRUITED OVER TWO PHASES: THE EXPLORATORY PHASE GROUP HAD A MEAN AGE OF 28.39 YEARS (SD 9.32) AND THE CONFIRMATORY PHASE GROUP HAD A MEAN AGE OF 32.84 YEARS (SD 12.72). PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE SMDS-12, THE INTERNET ADDICTION TEST, THE COVID-19 FEAR SCALE, AND THE 10-ITEM PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE. THE SMDS-12 WAS INITIALLY TESTED BY EXPLORATORY FACTOR ANALYSIS AND WAS SUBSEQUENTLY TESTED BY CONFIRMATORY FACTOR ANALYSIS. RESULTS: THE TEST SUPPORTED THE THREE-FACTOR STRUCTURE. IN ADDITION, NO ITEMS WERE REMOVED FROM THE MEASUREMENT SCALE, WITH THREE FACTORS EXPLAINING UP TO 73.72% OF THE TOTAL VARIANCE, AND THE ITEMS HAD A LAMBDA FACTOR LOADING RANGING FROM 0.73 TO 0.85. SUBSEQUENTLY, CONFIRMATORY FACTOR ANALYSIS CONFIRMED THE ROBUSTNESS OF THE MEASURE BY REFERRING TO A WIDE RANGE OF GOODNESS-OF-FIT INDICES THAT MET THE RECOMMENDED STANDARDS. THE CONSTRUCT VALIDITY OF THE SCALE WAS SUPPORTED BY ITS CONVERGENT AND DISCRIMINANT VALIDITY. THE RELIABILITY OF THE INSTRUMENT EXAMINED BY MEANS OF THREE INTERNAL CONSISTENCY INDICES, AND THE CORRECTED ITEM-TOTAL CORRELATION, DEMONSTRATED THAT THE THREE DIMENSIONS OF THE INSTRUMENT WERE RELIABLE: CRONBACH <U+0391> VALUES WERE .89, .88, AND .88 FOR THE CONSUMPTION, CONFIDENCE, AND SHARING SUBSCALES, RESPECTIVELY. THE CORRECTED ITEM-TOTAL CORRELATION RANGED FROM 0.70 TO 0.78. THE CORRELATION OF THE INSTRUMENT'S DIMENSIONS WITH INTERNET ADDICTION AND MENTAL HEALTH FACTORS SHOWED POSITIVE ASSOCIATIONS. CONCLUSIONS: THE SMDS-12 CAN BE RELIABLY UTILIZED TO MEASURE THE CREDIBILITY OF SOCIAL MEDIA DISINFORMATION AND CAN BE ADAPTED TO MEASURE THE CREDIBILITY OF DISINFORMATION IN OTHER CONTEXTS.

264,SOCIAL MEDIA AND COVID19 MISINFORMATION HOW IGNORANT FACEBOOK USERS ARE,"THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS CLAIMED A LOT OF LIVES AROUND THE WORLD, NOT ONLY WITH THE VIRUS BUT ALSO WITH MISINFORMATION. MANY RESEARCHERS HAVE INVESTIGATED COVID-19 MISINFORMATION, BUT NONE OF THEM WAS RELATED TO SOCIAL MEDIA USERSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ DIVERSE RESPONSES TO DIFFERENT TYPES OF COVID-19 MISINFORMATION, WHICH COULD BE A TIMELY EXPLORATION. TO BRIDGE THIS GAP IN SCHOLARLY LITERATURE, THE PRESENT STUDY BASED ON 11,716 COMMENTS FROM 876 FACEBOOK POSTS ON FIVE COVID-19 MISINFORMATION SEEKS TO ANSWER TWO RELEVANT RESEARCH QUESTIONS: (A) HOW IGNORANT SOCIAL MEDIA USERS ARE ABOUT MISINFORMATION? (B) HOW DO THEY REACT TO DIFFERENT TYPES OF MISINFORMATION? FOLLOWING A QUANTITATIVE CONTENT ANALYSIS METHOD, THIS STUDY PRODUCES A FEW NOVEL FINDINGS. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT MOST OF THE USERS TRUST MISINFORMATION (60.88%), AND FEWER CAN DENY (16.15%) OR DOUBT (13.30%) THE CLAIMS BASED ON PROPER REASONS. THE ACCEPTANCE OF RELIGIOUS MISINFORMATION (94.72%) SURPASSED OTHER TYPES OF MISINFORMATION. MOST OF THE USERS REACT HAPPILY (34.50%) TO MISINFORMATION: THE USERS WHO ACCEPT MISINFORMATION ARE MOSTLY HAPPY (55.02%) BECAUSE IT MAY SATISFY THEIR EXPECTATIONS, AND THE USERS WHO DISTRUST MISINFORMATION ARE MOSTLY ANGRY (44.05%) PRESUMING IT MAY CAUSE HARM TO PEOPLE. THE CHI-SQUARE AND PHI COEFFICIENT VALUES SHOW STRONG POSITIVE AND SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN THE THEMES, LEVELS OF IGNORANCE, AND REACTIONS TO MISINFORMATION.

THIS STATEWIDE SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN AIMED TO INCREASE PARENTAL AWARENESS OF AND BUILD VACCINE CONFIDENCE AROUND HPV VACCINATION IN S.C. THE TEN-WEEK CAMPAIGN WAS STRATEGICALLY IMPLEMENTED BETWEEN JUNE AND AUGUST 2019 TO ENCOURAGE HPV VACCINATION AT BACK-TO-SCHOOL MEDICAL APPOINTMENTS. A PROCESS EVALUATION SHOWED THAT THE CAMPAIGN RESULTED IN OVER 370,000 TOTAL IMPRESSIONS, REACHED OVER 33,000 INDIVIDUALS, AND CULMINATED WITH OVER 1122 FOLLOWERS. THERE WERE OVER 2700 ENGAGEMENTS ON FACEBOOK AND TWITTER. A QUALITATIVE CONTENT ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT PRO-VACCINE AND ANTI-VACCINE COMMENTS WERE DOMINATED BY PERSONAL STORIES. COMMENTS PROMOTING MISINFORMATION ABOUT THE HPV VACCINE WERE OFTEN COUNTERED THROUGH PEER-TO-PEER DIALOGUE. FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT CREATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE TARGET AUDIENCE TO ENGAGE WITH CAMPAIGN MESSAGES EFFECTIVELY CORRECTED MISINFORMATION. Ã‚Â© 2021 BY THE AUTHORS.

HOWEVER, MOST PRIOR WORK HAS LACKED FOCUS ON STUDYING THEIR USAGE DURING DISASTERS IN THE GLOBAL SOUTH, WHERE INTERNET ACCESS AND SOCIAL MEDIA USAGE DIFFERS FROM DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. IN THIS PAPER, WE STUDY SOCIAL MEDIA USE IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE 7.1-MAGNITUDE EARTHQUAKE THAT HIT MEXICO ON THE 19TH OF SEPTEMBER, 2017 (KNOWN AS THE #19S EARTHQUAKE). WE CONDUCT AN ANALYSIS OF HOW PARTICIPANTS UTILIZED SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS IN THE #19S AFTERMATH. OUR RESEARCH EXTENDS INVESTIGATIONS OF CRISIS INFORMATICS BY (1) EXAMINING HOW PARTICIPANTS USED DIFFERENT SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS IN THE AFTERMATH OF A NATURAL DISASTER IN A GLOBAL SOUTH COUNTRY. (2) UNCOVERING HOW INDIVIDUALS DEVELOPED THEIR OWN PROCESSES TO VERIFY NEWS REPORTS USING AN ON-THE-GROUND CITIZENS APPROACH. (3) REVEALING HOW PEOPLE DEVELOPED THEIR OWN MECHANISMS TO DEAL WITH OUTDATED INFORMATION. FOR THIS, WE SURVEYED 356 PEOPLE. ADDITIONALLY, WE ANALYZE ONE MONTH OF ACTIVITY FROM FACEBOOK (12,606 POSTS), TWITTER (2,909,109 TWEETS), SLACK (28,782 MESSAGES), AND GITHUB (2602 COMMITS). THIS WORK OFFERS A MULTI-PLATFORM VIEW ON USER BEHAVIOR TO COORDINATE RELIEF EFFORTS, REDUCE THE SPREAD OF MISINFORMATION, AND DEAL WITH OBSOLETE INFORMATION WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN ESSENTIAL TO HELP IN THE COORDINATION AND EFFICIENCY OF RELIEF EFFORTS.

295,CONSPIRACY VS SCIENCE A LARGESCALE ANALYSIS OF ONLINE DISCUSSION CASCADES,"WITH THE EMERGENCE AND RAPID PROLIFERATION OF SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS AND SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES, RECENT YEARS HAVE WITNESSED A SURGE OF MISINFORMATION SPREADING IN OUR DAILY LIFE. DRAWING ON A LARGE-SCALE DATASET WHICH COVERS MORE THAN 1.4M POSTS AND 18M COMMENTS FROM AN ONLINE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM, WE INVESTIGATE THE PROPAGATION OF TWO DISTINCT NARRATIVESÃ¢â‚¬â€œ(I) CONSPIRACY INFORMATION, WHOSE CLAIMS ARE GENERALLY UNSUBSTANTIATED AND THUS REFERRED AS MISINFORMATION TO SOME EXTENT, AND (II) SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION, WHOSE ORIGINS ARE GENERALLY READILY IDENTIFIABLE AND VERIFIABLE. WE FIND THAT CONSPIRACY CASCADES TEND TO PROPAGATE IN A MULTIGENERATIONAL BRANCHING PROCESS WHEREAS SCIENCE CASCADES ARE MORE LIKELY TO GROW IN A BREADTH-FIRST MANNER. SPECIFICALLY, CONSPIRACY INFORMATION TRIGGERS LARGER CASCADES, INVOLVES MORE USERS AND GENERATIONS, PERSISTS LONGER, AND IS MORE VIRAL AND BURSTY THAN SCIENCE INFORMATION. CONTENT ANALYSIS REVEALS THAT CONSPIRACY CASCADES CONTAIN MORE NEGATIVE WORDS AND EMOTIONAL WORDS WHICH CONVEY ANGER, FEAR, DISGUST, SURPRISE AND TRUST. WE ALSO FIND THAT CONSPIRACY CASCADES ARE MUCH MORE CONCERNED WITH POLITICAL AND CONTROVERSIAL TOPICS. AFTER APPLYING MACHINE LEARNING MODELS, WE ACHIEVE AN AUC SCORE OF NEARLY 90% IN DISCRIMINATING CONSPIRACY FROM SCIENCE NARRATIVES USING THE CONSTRUCTED FEATURES. WE FURTHER INVESTIGATE USERÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S ROLE DURING THE GROWTH OF CASCADES. IN CONTRAST WITH PREVIOUS ASSUMPTION THAT MISINFORMATION IS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A SMALL SET OF USERS, WE FIND THAT CONSPIRACY CASCADES ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE CONTROLLED BY A BROADER SET OF USERS THAN SCIENCE CASCADES, IMPOSING NEW CHALLENGES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF MISINFORMATION. ALTHOUGH POLITICAL AFFINITY IS THOUGHT TO AFFECT THE CONSUMPTION OF MISINFORMATION, THERE IS VERY LITTLE EVIDENCE THAT POLITICAL ORIENTATION OF THE INFORMATION SOURCE PLAYS A ROLE DURING THE PROPAGATION OF CONSPIRACY INFORMATION; INSTEAD, WE FIND THAT CONSPIRACY INFORMATION FROM MEDIA OUTLETS WITH LEFT OR RIGHT ORIENTATION TRIGGERS SMALLER CASCADES AND IS LESS VIRAL THAN INFORMATION FROM ONLINE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS (E.G., TWITTER AND IMGUR) WHOSE POLITICAL ORIENTATIONS ARE UNCLEAR. OUR STUDY PROVIDES COMPLEMENTING EVIDENCE TO CURRENT MISINFORMATION RESEARCH AND HAS PRACTICAL POLICY IMPLICATIONS TO STEM THE PROPAGATION AND MITIGATE THE INFLUENCE OF MISINFORMATION ONLINE.

304,ATTENTION TO MISLEADING AND CONTENTIOUS TWEETS IN THE CASE OF HURRICANE HARVEY,"THE SPREAD OF FALSE AND MISLEADING INFORMATION THROUGH ONLINE SOCIAL MEDIA IS AN ELEVATED CONCERN IN EMERGENCY CONTEXTS SUCH AS NATURAL DISASTERS, WHERE THE ON-THE GROUND DECISION-MAKING WINDOW IS SHORTER, AND THE STAKES CAN BE PARTICULARLY HIGH. MISINFORMATION THAT GETS ATTENTION AND IS DRAWN OUT LONGER DURING AND AFTER SUCH DISASTERS POTENTIALLY PUTS THE AFFECTED POPULATION AT ADDITIONAL RISK. THIS RESEARCH FOCUSES ON POPULAR BUT AMBIGUOUS AND CONTENTIOUS NARRATIVES TRANSMITTED VIA TWITTER DURING HURRICANE HARVEY. TWO MOST TALKED ABOUT CONTENTIOUS NARRATIVES CONSISTED OF (1) GOVERNMENT AGENCIES PUTTING UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS AT RISK AND (2) DECISIONS ABOUT EVACUATION. THEY DEPICT THE PROCESS OF DEBUNKING, COMPETING NARRATIVES, AND POLITICAL IDEOLOGY THAT HAVE KEPT THE STORIES ALIVE. OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THE FOLLOWING: THAT GOVERNMENT AND REPORTERS PLAY IMPORTANT ROLES IN STEMMING THE SPREAD OF CONTENTIOUS OR FALSE INFORMATION; AMBIGUOUS AND CONTENTIOUS NARRATIVES REMAIN IN THE CONVERSATION LONGER, SPECIFIC DEBUNKING WORKS FASTER AND REACHES A LARGER AUDIENCE THAN GENERAL OR CONFUSED DEBUNKING; AND THE LACK OF COORDINATION OF MESSAGING ONLINE AND ON THE GROUND AS WELL AS AMONG DIFFERENT GOVERNMENT AGENCIES MAY THREATEN THE TIMELY AND ACCURATE DELIVERY OF DISASTER RESPONSES.

SOCIAL MEDIA, WITH THEIR INSTANTANEOUS AND WIDESPREAD USAGE, HAVE BEEN EXPLOITED BY Ã¢â‚¬ËœANONYMOUSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ POLITICAL INFLUENCERS WHO FABRICATE AND INUNDATE INTERNET COMMUNITY WITH UNVERIFIED AND FALSE INFORMATION. USING VAN LEEUWENÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S DISCOURSE LEGITIMATION APPROACH AND INSIGHTS FROM DISCOURSE ANALYSIS, THIS STUDY ANALYSES 120 PURPOSIVELY SAMPLED FAKE NEWS POSTS ON WHATSAPP, FACEBOOK AND TWITTER, SHARED DURING THE 2019 GENERAL ELECTIONS IN NIGERIA. WHATSAPP ALLOWS FOR THE EASY AND FAST SHARING OF FAKE NEWS AS IT PULLED THE LARGEST OCCURRENCE OF LEGITIMATION STRATEGIES, FOLLOWED BY FACEBOOK. AUTHORISATION IS THE HIGHEST OCCURRING LEGITIMATION STRATEGY AT 46.6% FREQUENCY; THIS IS FOLLOWED BY MORALISATION WHICH HAS 27% AND RATIONALISATION AT 26.4%; WHILE MYTHOPOESIS DID NOT FEATURE AT ALL IN THE SAMPLED DATA, LEAVING IT AT 0%. IN PARTICULAR, EXPERT AND ROLE MODEL AUTHORITY ARE MOST OFTEN DEPLOYED TO VALIDATE FAKE NEWS SUCH AS THE DEMISE AND CLONING OF PRESIDENT BUHARI, RULING PARTYÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S PLAN TO RIG AND DESTABILISE THE 2019 ELECTION, MASSIVE CORRUPTION IN THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION AND IMMINENT ETHNIC VIOLENCE. THE STUDY ARGUES THAT THESE STRATEGIES ARE VIABLE PERSUASIVE TOOLS OWING TO THEIR USE OF DISCOURSE MARKERS LIKE MAKE-BELIEVE IMAGES, EMOTIVE LANGUAGE, APPEAL TO EMOTIONS, RATIONAL CONCLUSIONS, HATEFUL COMMENTS, VERBAL INDICTMENT AND COERCIVE VERBS.

HOWEVER, THE ABSENCE OF ADEQUATE CONTROL MECHANISMS ON THIS MEDIUM HAS LED TO CONCERNS ABOUT THE CREDIBILITY OF INFORMATION IN CIRCULATION. WHILE THIS TOPIC HAS GAINED RESEARCHERSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ ATTENTION, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE FACTORS WHICH ALLOW INDIVIDUALS TO DETECT FAKE NEWS AND LEAD THEM TO TRUST SOCIAL MEDIA AS A SOURCE OF INFORMATION, AND WHETHER THIS VARIES ACROSS CULTURES. THIS CROSS-CULTURAL STUDY CONDUCTED IN SPAIN AND LEBANON USES STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELLING TO EXPLORE THESE FACTORS AND PRESENTS THEM WITHIN A BEHAVIOURAL MODEL. FINDINGS SHOW THAT VERIFICATION BEHAVIOUR, INFORMATION SKILLS AND EDUCATION HAVE A POSITIVE INFLUENCE ON FAKE NEWS DETECTION WITH A STRONGER IMPACT IN LEBANON.

DATA WERE DRAWN FROM 385 SOCIAL MEDIA USERS IN NIGERIA, AND PARTIAL LEAST SQUARES (PLS) WAS USED TO ANALYSE THE DATA. WE FOUND THAT NEWS-FIND-ME PERCEPTION, INFORMATION OVERLOAD, TRUST IN ONLINE INFORMATION, STATUS SEEKING, SELF-EXPRESSION AND INFORMATION SHARING PREDICTED FAKE NEWS SHARING RELATED TO COVID-19 PANDEMIC AMONG SOCIAL MEDIA USERS IN NIGERIA. GREATER EFFECTS OF NEWS-FIND-ME PERCEPTION AND INFORMATION OVERLOAD WERE FOUND ON FAKE NEWS SHARING BEHAVIOUR AS COMPARED TO TRUST IN ONLINE INFORMATION, STATUS SEEKING, SELF-EXPRESSION AND INFORMATION SHARING. THEORETICALLY, OUR STUDY ENRICHES THE CURRENT LITERATURE BY FOCUSING ON THE AFFORDANCES OF SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE ABUNDANCE OF ONLINE INFORMATION IN PREDICTING FAKE NEWS SHARING BEHAVIOUR AMONG SOCIAL MEDIA USERS, ESPECIALLY IN NIGERIA.

391,A DATADRIVEN FRAMEWORK FOR CODING THE INTENT AND EXTENT OF POLITICAL TWEETING DISINFORMATION AND EXTREMISM,"DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGNS ON ONLINE SOCIAL NETWORKS (OSNS) IN RECENT YEARS HAVE UN-DERSCORED DEMOCRACYÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S VULNERABILITY TO SUCH OPERATIONS AND THE IMPORTANCE OF IDENTIFYING SUCH OPERATIONS AND DISSECTING THEIR METHODS, INTENTS, AND SOURCE. THIS PAPER IS ANOTHER MILESTONE IN A LINE OF RESEARCH ON POLITICAL DISINFORMATION, PROPAGANDA, AND EXTREMISM ON OSNS. A TOTAL OF 40,000 ORIGINAL TWEETS (NOT RE-TWEETS OR REPLIES) RELATED TO THE U.S. 2020 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION ARE COLLECTED. THE INTENT, FOCUS, AND POLITICAL AFFILIATION OF THESE POLITICAL TWEETS ARE DETERMINED THROUGH MULTIPLE DISCUSSIONS AND REVISIONS. THERE ARE THREE POLITICAL AFFILIATIONS: RIGHTIST, LEFTIST, AND NEUTRAL. A TOTAL OF 171 DIFFERENT CLASSES OF INTENT OR FOCUS ARE DEFINED FOR TWEETS. A TOTAL OF 25% OF TWEETS WERE LEFT OUT WHILE DEFINING THESE CLASSES OF INTENT. THE PURPOSE IS TO ASSURE THAT THE DEFINED CLASSES WOULD BE ABLE TO COVER THE INTENT AND FOCUS OF UNSEEN TWEETS (TWEETS THAT WERE NOT USED TO DETERMINE AND DEFINE THESE CLASSES) AND NO NEW CLASSES WOULD BE REQUIRED. THIS PAPER PROVIDES THESE CLASSES, THEIR DEFINITION AND SIZE, AND EXAMPLE TWEETS FROM THEM. IF ANY INFORMATION IS INCLUDED IN A TWEET, ITS FACTUALITY IS VERIFIED THROUGH VALID NEWS SOURCES AND ARTICLES. IF ANY OPINION IS INCLUDED IN A TWEET, IT IS DETERMINED THAT WHETHER OR NOT IT IS EXTREME, THROUGH MULTIPLE DISCUSSIONS AND REVISIONS. THIS PAPER PROVIDES ANALYTICS WITH REGARD TO THE POLITICAL AFFILIATION AND INTENT OF TWEETS. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT DISINFORMATION AND EXTREME OPINIONS ARE MORE COMMON AMONG RIGHTISTS TWEETS THAN LEFTIST TWEETS. ADDITIONALLY, CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC IS THE TOPIC OF ALMOST HALF OF THE TWEETS, WHERE 25.43% OF TWEETS EXPRESS THEIR UNHAPPINESS WITH HOW REPUBLICANS HAVE HANDLED THIS PANDEMIC.

392,CORRECTING MISINFORMATION USING THEORYDRIVEN MESSAGES HPV VACCINE MISPERCEPTIONS INFORMATION SEEKING AND THE MODERATING ROLE OF REFLECTION,"DESPITE THE FACT THAT SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE HAS REPEATEDLY AFFIRMED THE SAFETY OF THE HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS (HPV) VACCINE, UNCONFIRMED STORIES ON SOCIAL MEDIA THAT ALLEGE THE VACCINE IS HARMFUL HAS LED TO VACCINATION REFUSAL, WHICH DRASTICALLY HAMPERS IMMUNIZATION RATES. ALTHOUGH SOCIAL MEDIA MAKES IT EASY FOR THE SPREAD OF MISINFORMATION, THESE PLATFORMS ARE ALSO SUITABLE FOR MISINFORMATION CORRECTION. THE CURRENT STUDY EMPLOYS AN EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN TO 1) TEST THEORY-BASED CORRECTION MESSAGES USING LOSS- VS. GAIN-FRAMES, TO COMBAT MISINFORMATION ONLINE IN THE CONTEXT OF FACEBOOK, 2) EXTEND THE EFFECTS OF CORRECTION MESSAGES FROM MISPERCEPTIONS TO BEHAVIORAL INTENTIONS, AND 3) EXAMINE THE CONDITIONAL EFFECTS OF REFLECTION WHICH IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT VARIABLES FOR INFORMATION PROCESSING. OUR FINDINGS DEMONSTRATED THAT INDIVIDUALS WITH LOW REFLECTION HAD LOWER MISPERCEPTIONS ABOUT THE VACCINE WHEN EXPOSED TO LOSS-FRAMED MESSAGES. HOWEVER, EXPOSURE TO LOSS- OR GAIN-FRAMED MESSAGES DID NOT SEEM TO DIFFER THE MISPERCEPTIONS FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH HIGH REFLECTION. ADDITIONALLY, OUR FINDINGS SHOWED THAT LOSS-FRAMING ELICITED LOWER INFORMATION SEEKING INTENTION AMONG INDIVIDUALS WITH LOW REFLECTION. IMPLICATIONS ARE DISCUSSED.

395,SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE SPREAD OF COVID19 INFODEMIC,"PURPOSE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO INVESTIGATE THE SOCIAL MEDIA APPLICATION AND THE SPREAD OF COVID-19 INFODEMIC IN NIGERIA. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: A DESCRIPTIVE SURVEY RESEARCH DESIGN WAS USED FOR THIS STUDY. A TOTAL OF 1,200 SOCIAL MEDIA USERS, REGARDLESS OF THEIR PROFESSIONS, WERE RANDOMLY SELECTED FOR THE STUDY BETWEENMID-JUNE AND JULY 2020. STRATIFIED AND PURPOSIVE SAMPLING TECHNIQUES WERE USED FOR THIS STUDY. THE QUESTIONNAIRE WAS DESIGNED USING GOOGLE FORM AND ADMINISTERED USING WHATSAPP AND TELEGRAM TO SOCIAL MEDIA USERS ABOVE 18 YEARS OLD IN NIGERIA. THE DATA GENERATED WAS ANALYZED USING DESCRIPTIVE (FREQUENCY COUNT) AND INFERENTIAL (MEAN) STATISTICS, AND WAS PRESENTED IN TABLES. FINDINGS: IT WAS FOUND THAT PEOPLE MAKE USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC FOR DIVERSE REASONS SUCH AS LISTENING TO ANNOUNCEMENT TO BE INFORMED, KNOWING THE NECESSARY MEASURES TO TAKE BY THOSE INFECTED AND SPREADING UP-TO-DATE INFORMATION ON THE PANDEMIC. SOCIAL MEDIA TOOLS WERE HIGHLY USED DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, ESPECIALLY WHATSAPP AND ZOOM. FINDINGS REFLECTED THAT MISINFORMATION WAS SPREAD ON SOCIAL MEDIA. THIS STUDY ALSO SHOWED THAT THE INFODEMIC ASSOCIATED WITH COVID-19 IS MANAGED BY CONFIRMING THE SOURCE OF THE INFORMATION BEFORE SHARING IT AND TRUSTING INFORMATION FROM RELIABLE SOURCES. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: THE RESULT OF THIS RESEARCH WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE BODY OF KNOWLEDGE ON SOCIAL MEDIA APPLICATION, FAKE NEWS AND THE SPREAD OF COVID-19 INFODEMIC IN NIGERIA AND BEYOND. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: INFODEMIC IS A DISASTER IN THE HEALTH SECTOR. THE SPREAD OF INFODEMIC IS CAPABLE OF MISLEADING PEOPLE, LOSING TRUST IN GOVERNMENT, HEALTH PROVIDERS AND HEALTH REGULATORY AUTHORITIES. THIS STUDY WILL HELP SOCIAL MEDIA USERS TO KNOW HOW TO PROPERLY MANAGE SOCIAL MEDIA INFODEMIC DURING A PANDEMIC OR ANY HEALTH-RELATED SITUATIONS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: THIS STUDY IS NOVEL AS IT APPROACHES FAKE NEWS FROM A COVID-19 PERSPECTIVE. VERY FEW ARTICLES EMANATE FROM THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES IN THIS AREA. THIS WAS BECAUSE MOST OF THE NARRATIVE AROUND FAKE NEWS PREVIOUSLY CENTERED AROUND THE WESTERN OCCURRENCES SUCH AS THE IRAQI INVASION BY THE USA, THE US PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS AND BREXIT. COVID-19 HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT THE DEVELOPING WORLD IS NOT IMMUNE FROM FAKE NEWS AS WELL. THIS STUDY, THEREFORE, ASSESSED THE MANAGEMENT OF INFODEMIC ASSOCIATED WITH COVID-19 IN NIGERIA.

406,DISINFORMATION IN FACEBOOK ADS IN THE 2019 SPANISH GENERAL ELECTION CAMPAIGNS,"AS FAKE NEWS ELICITS AN EMOTIONAL RESPONSE FROM USERS, WHOSE ATTENTION IS THEN MONETISED, POLITICAL ADVERTISING HAS A SIG-NIFICANT INFLUENCE ON ITS PRODUCTION AND DISSEMINATION. FACEBOOK ADS, THEREFORE, HAVE AN ESSENTIAL ROLE IN CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL COMMUNICATION, NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF THEIR EXTENSIVE USE IN INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS, BUT ALSO BECAUSE THEY ADDRESS INTRIGUING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE REGULATION OF DISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES. THIS RESEARCH EMPLOYS A CORPUS OF 14,684 FACEBOOK ADS PUBLISHED BY THE MAJOR NATIONAL POLITICAL PARTIES DURING THEIR CAMPAIGNS LEADING UP TO THE TWO SPANISH GENERAL ELECTIONS HELD IN 2019. A MANUAL CONTENT ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED ON ALL THE VISUALLY IDENTICAL ADS SO AS TO IDENTIFY THOSE CONTAINING DISINFORMATION AND THOSE DENOUNCING IT. THE TOPICS ADDRESSED IN THESE ADS WERE THEN EXAM-INED. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE POLITICAL PARTIESÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ FACEBOOK AD STRATEGIES WERE AKIN TO THOSE OF CONVENTIONAL ADVERTISING. DISINFORMATION MESSAGES WERE INFREQUENT AND MAINLY POSTED BY CIUDADANOS AND VOX. NONETHELESS, IT IS STRIKING THAT THE MAIN TOPIC ADDRESSED IN THE ADS WAS THE UNITY OF SPAINÃ¢â‚¬â€PRECISELY THE ISSUE OF CATALONIAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S INDEPENDENCE.

IT IS ALSO STRUCTURED BY INFORMATION POVERTY, LOCAL LATINX BORDER PRACTICES, AND CULTURAL CONSTRUCTS SUCH AS CHISME AND A CULTURE OF SKEPTICISM.

DOCTORED VIDEOS SENT OVER THE PLATFORM HAVE ELICITED VISCERAL RESPONSES AMONG USERS, RESULTING IN THE WRONGFUL DEATH OF INNOCENT PEOPLE. WOULD THE RESPONSES HAVE BEEN SO STRONG IF THE FALSE NEWS WERE CIRCULATED IN TEXT OR AUDIO? IS VIDEO MODALITY THE REASON FOR SUCH POWERFUL EFFECTS? WE EXPLORED THIS QUESTION BY COMPARING REACTIONS TO THREE FALSE STORIES PREPARED IN EITHER TEXT-ONLY, AUDIO-ONLY, OR VIDEO FORMATS, AMONG RURAL AND URBAN USERS IN INDIA. OUR FINDINGS REVEAL THAT VIDEO IS PROCESSED MORE SUPERFICIALLY, AND THEREFORE USERS BELIEVE IN IT MORE READILY AND SHARE IT WITH OTHERS. ASIDE FROM ADVANCING OUR THEORETICAL UNDERSTANDING OF MODALITY EFFECTS IN THE CONTEXT OF MOBILE MEDIA, OUR FINDINGS ALSO HOLD PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS FOR DESIGN OF MODALITY-BASED FLAGGING OF FAKE NEWS, AND LITERACY CAMPAIGNS TO INOCULATE USERS AGAINST MISINFORMATION. LAY SUMMARY FALSE RUMORS ON MESSAGING PLATFORMS LIKE WHATSAPP ARE ON THE RISE. THESE RUMORS, HOWEVER, CAN HAVE DEADLY EFFECTS. FOR EXAMPLE, A FALSE VIDEO LED TO SEVERAL MURDERS OF SUSPECTED CHILD KIDNAPPERS IN INDIA. IS IT BECAUSE IT WAS IN VIDEO FORMAT? FAKE NEWS STORIES ON SOCIAL MEDIA USED TO BE MOSTLY TEXT. TODAY, THEY APPEAR IN RICHER FORMATS LIKE PICTURES, AUDIO, AND VIDEO. DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES ALLOW US TO EASILY CREATE FAKE CONTENT IN ALL THESE FORMATS. BUT, IS FAKE NEWS MORE BELIEVED WHEN IT IS IN A RICHER FORMAT LIKE VIDEO? ARE PEOPLE MORE LIKELY TO SHARE IT WITH OTHERS? WE RAN A FIELD EXPERIMENT IN INDIA TO FIND OUT. THE EXPERIMENT COMPARED REACTIONS TO THREE FALSE STORIES. WE SHOWED DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THE SAME STORY TO DIFFERENT PARTICIPANTS. IN OUR WORK, WE FIND THAT USERS FALL FOR FAKE NEWS MORE WHEN PRESENTED IN VIDEO FORM. THIS IS BECAUSE THEY TEND TO BELIEVE WHAT THEY SEE; MORE THAN WHAT THEY HEAR OR READ.

599,WHEN WEB ADDON CORRECTION COMES WITH FEARAROUSING MISINFORMATION IN PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS FOCUSING ON THE ROLE OF RISK PERCEPTION IN BELIEF IN MISINFORMATION,"THE GOAL OF THIS RESEARCH WAS TO STUDY HOW FEAR-AROUSING MISINFORMATION (FAM) ELICITS A BACKFIRE EFFECT OF WEB ADD-ON CORRECTION AND WHETHER SITUATIONAL FEAR AND SITUATIONAL THREAT APPRAISALS INTERVENE IN THE RELATIONSHIP. THE STUDY FEATURED AN ONLINE EXPERIMENT (N = 167) WITH A 2 (MISINFORMATION: FEAR-NEUTRAL VS. FEAR-AROUSAL) X 2 (PRESENCE OF CORRECTION: NO CORRECTION VS. WEB ADD-ON CORRECTION) BETWEEN-GROUP FACTORIAL DESIGN. RESULTS SUGGEST THAT WEB ADD-ON CORRECTION WAS EFFECTIVE IN DECREASING SITUATIONAL SUSCEPTIBILITY WHEN FEAR-NEUTRAL MISINFORMATION WAS DISPLAYED (BUT NOT WHEN FAM WAS PRESENTED) AND THAT THIS SUSCEPTIBILITY IS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH BELIEF IN MISINFORMATION.

METHODS THE SEARCH TERM ""BLADDER PAIN SYNDROME"" WAS USED ON YOUTUBE(TM) PLATFORM. THE FIRST 100 VIDEOS WERE SELECTED. PATIENT EDUCATION MATERIALS ASSESSMENT TOOL FOR AUDIO-VISUAL CONTENT (PEMAT A/V), GLOBAL QUALITY SCORE (GQS), MISINFORMATION TOOL, AND DISCERN SCORE WERE USED TO ASSESS VIDEOS' QUALITY CONTENT. PEARSON'S TEST WAS USED TO ASSESS POTENTIAL CORRELATIONS BETWEEN VARIABLES. RESULTS SEVENTY-NINE VIDEOS WERE SUITABLE FOR THE ANALYSES. THE MEDIAN PEMAT A/V UNDERSTANDABILITY SCORE AND PEMAT A/V ACTIONABILITY SCORE WERE 66.7% (INTERQUARTILE RANGE [IQR]: 46.2-100.0) AND 75.0% (IQR: 37.5-100.0), RESPECTIVELY. ACCORDING TO GQS, 26 (32.9%), 32 (40.5%), 3 (3.8%), 15 (19.0%), AND 3 (3.8%) VIDEOS WERE EXCELLENT, GOOD, MODERATE, GENERALLY POOR, AND POOR, RESPECTIVELY. ACCORDING TO MISINFORMATION TOOL, OF ALL VIDEOS, 81% (N = 64), 6.3% (N = 5), 5.1% (N = 4), 5.1% (N = 4), 2.5% (N = 2) HAD RESPECTIVELY NO, VERY LITTLE, MODERATE, HIGH, AND EXTREME MISINFORMATION. THE OVERALL MEDIAN DISCERN SCORE RANGED FROM 5.0 (IQR: 2.0-5.0) TO 5.0 (IQR: 5.0-5.0). A POSITIVE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT CORRELATION WAS FOUND BETWEEN VIDEO LENGTH AND PEMAT A/V UNDERSTANDABILITY (R = 0.27, P = 0.01), VIDEO LENGTH AND PEMAT A/V ACTIONABILITY (R = .26, P = 0.02), AND VIDEO LENGTH AND DISCERN QUESTION 16 (R = 0.28, P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS NOWADAY, THE OVERALL QUALITY OF YOUTUBE(TM) VIDEOS ON BPS HAVE BEEN EVALUATED GOOD ACCORDING TO PEMAT A/V, GQS, MISINFORMATION TOOL, AND DISCERN SCORE.

617,UNDERSTANDING RTS AUDIENCES EXPOSURE NOT ENDORSEMENT FOR TWITTER FOLLOWERS OF RUSSIAN STATESPONSORED MEDIA,"THE RUSSIAN STATE-FUNDED INTERNATIONAL BROADCASTER RT (FORMERLY RUSSIA TODAY) HAS ATTRACTED MUCH ATTENTION AS A PURVEYOR OF RUSSIAN PROPAGANDA. TO DATE, MOST STUDIES OF RT HAVE FOCUSED ON ITS BROADCAST, WEBSITE, AND SOCIAL MEDIA CONTENT, WITH LITTLE RESEARCH ON ITS AUDIENCES. THROUGH A DATA-DRIVEN APPLICATION OF NETWORK SCIENCE AND OTHER COMPUTATIONAL METHODS, WE ADDRESS THIS GAP TO PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO THE DEMOGRAPHICS AND INTERESTS OF RT'S TWITTER FOLLOWERS, AS WELL AS HOW THEY ENGAGE WITH RT. BUILDING UPON RECENT STUDIES OF RUSSIAN STATE-SPONSORED MEDIA, WE REPORT THREE MAIN RESULTS. FIRST, WE FIND THAT MOST OF RT'S TWITTER FOLLOWERS ONLY VERY RARELY ENGAGE WITH ITS CONTENT AND TEND TO BE EXPOSED TO RT'S CONTENT ALONGSIDE OTHER MAINSTREAM NEWS CHANNELS. THIS INDICATES THAT RT IS NOT A CENTRAL PART OF THEIR ONLINE NEWS MEDIA ENVIRONMENT. SECOND, USING PROBABILISTIC COMPUTATIONAL METHODS, WE SHOW THAT FOLLOWERS OF RT ARE SLIGHTLY MORE LIKELY TO BE OLDER AND MALE THAN AVERAGE TWITTER USERS, AND THEY ARE FAR MORE LIKELY TO BE BOTS. THIRD, WE IDENTIFY THIRTY-FIVE DISTINCT AUDIENCE SEGMENTS, WHICH VARY IN TERMS OF THEIR NATIONALITY, LANGUAGES, AND INTERESTS. THIS AUDIENCE SEGMENTATION REVEALS THE CONSIDERABLE HETEROGENEITY OF RT'S TWITTER FOLLOWERS. ACCORDINGLY, WE CONCLUDE THAT GENERALIZATIONS ABOUT RT'S AUDIENCE BASED ON ANALYSES OF RT'S MEDIA CONTENT, OR ON VOCAL MINORITIES AMONG ITS WIDER AUDIENCES, ARE UNHELPFUL AND LIMIT OUR UNDERSTANDING OF RT AND ITS APPEAL TO INTERNATIONAL AUDIENCES.",RT (RUSSIA TODAY); TWITTER; RUSSIAN PROPAGANDA; AUDIENCE RESEARCH; COMPUTATIONAL ANALYSIS,PUBLIC DIPLOMACY; STRATEGY; NEWS; WAR,2022,https://doi.org/10.1177/1940161220980692,"7,8",NA,0,0,0,UNITED KINGDOM,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRESS-POLITICS
188,CULTURAL VARIANCE IN RECEPTION AND INTERPRETATION OF SOCIAL MEDIA COVID19 DISINFORMATION IN FRENCHSPEAKING REGIONS,"DIGITAL COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY HAS CREATED A WORLD IN WHICH MEDIA ARE CAPABLE OF CROSSING NATIONAL BOUNDARIES AS NEVER BEFORE. AS A RESULT, LANGUAGE IS INCREASINGLY THE SALIENT CATEGORY DETERMINING INDIVIDUALSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ MEDIA CONSUMPTION. TODAY, A SINGLE SOCIAL MEDIA POST CAN TRAVEL AROUND THE WORLD, REACHING ANYONE WHO SPEAKS ITS LANGUAGE. THIS POSES SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES TO COMBATTING THE SPREAD OF DISINFORMATION, AS AN EVER-GROWING POOL OF DISINFORMATION PURVEYORS REACH AUDIENCES LARGER THAN EVER BEFORE. THIS DYNAMIC IS COMPLICATED, HOWEVER, BY THE DIVERSITY OF AUDIENCE INTERPRETATIONS OF MESSAGE CONTENT WITHIN A PARTICULAR LANGUAGE GROUP. BOTH ACROSS AND WITHIN NATIONAL BOUNDARIES, A SINGLE MESSAGE MAY BE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF INTERPRETATIONS DEPENDING ON THE CULTURAL EXPERIENCES AND IDENTITIES OF ITS RECIPIENTS. THIS STUDY EXPLORES THAT DYNAMIC THROUGH ANALYSIS OF FRENCH LANGUAGE ANTI-VACCINE AND COVID-DENIALIST DISINFORMATION. USING QUALITATIVE CODING METHODOLOGY, A TEAM OF RESEARCHERS EMPIRICALLY IDENTIFY COMMON AND FAR-REACHING PATTERNS OF FRANCOPHONE COVID DISINFORMATION NARRATIVES AND RHETORIC. THESE NARRATIVES AND RHETORICS ARE THEN SUBJECTED TO HERMENEUTIC CLOSE READING TO DETERMINE LIKELY VARIATIONS IN THEIR RECEPTION ACROSS DIFFERENT FRENCH-SPEAKING CULTURES. DATA WERE GATHERED AND ANALYZED BETWEEN THE DATES OF 24 MARCH 2021 AND 27 APRIL 2021.

THIS ARTICLE ADDRESSES THIS QUESTION BY COLLECTING, CATEGORISING, AND SITUATING AN EXTENSIVE BODY OF RESEARCH ON HOW APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACES (APIS) PROVIDED BY SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS FACILITATE THE SPREAD OF DISINFORMATION. WE FIRST EXAMINE THE LANDSCAPE OF OFFICIAL SOCIAL MEDIA APIS, THEN PERFORM QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH ON THE OPEN-SOURCE CODE REPOSITORIES GITHUB AND GITLAB TO UNDERSTAND THE USAGE PATTERNS OF THESE APIS. BY INSPECTING THE CODE REPOSITORIES, WE CLASSIFY DEVELOPERS' USAGE OF THE APIS AS OFFICIAL AND UNOFFICIAL, AND FURTHER DEVELOP A FOUR-STAGE FRAMEWORK CHARACTERISING PATHWAYS FOR SPREADING DISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS.

PARTICIPANTS IN THE EXPERIMENTAL (INOCULATION) CONDITION WATCHED A VIDEO THAT EXPLAINED COMMON RHETORICAL MARKERS OF RADICAL-ISLAMIST AND ISLAMOPHOBIC DISINFORMATION THAT HAD BEEN IDENTIFIED IN AN ANALYSIS OF YOUTUBE CONTENT. THE INFORMATION WAS PRESENTED IN A NEUTRAL CONTEXT NOT INVOLVING ISLAM AND FOCUSED ON ANALYSIS OF THE MISLEADING ARGUMENTATION. THE CONTROL GROUP WATCHED A VIDEO ABOUT AN UNRELATED TOPIC. PARTICIPANTS WERE THEN EXPOSED TO TARGET VIDEOS WITH Ã¢â‚¬Å“GATEWAYÃ¢â‚¬Â CONTENT THAT CONSTITUTED AN ENTRY POINT TO POTENTIAL ISLAMIST OR ISLAMOPHOBIC RADICALIZATION. BOTH VIDEOS CONTAINED NUMEROUS ITEMS OF DISINFORMATION. PARTICIPANTS THEN ANSWERED A VARIETY OF QUESTIONS SUCH AS HOW LIKELY THEY WERE TO SHARE THE VIDEO, THEIR LEVEL OF AGREEMENT, AND THEIR PERCEIVED ACCURACY OF THE VIDEO. PARTICIPANTS WHO HAD RECEIVED THE INOCULATION DISPLAYED LESS AGREEMENT WITH THE VIDEO CONTENT, PERCEIVED THE VIDEO AS LESS RELIABLE, AND WERE LESS LIKELY TO SHARE IT IN COMPARISON WITH PARTICIPANTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP.

TO FURTHER EXPLORE WHAT CONTRIBUTED TO FAKE NEWS SUSCEPTIBILITY OF SOCIAL MEDIA USERS, THE RESEARCH 1) INTEGRATED A WIDELY-ADOPTED MASS COMMUNICATION THEORY OF THIRD-PERSON PERCEPTION (TPP) WITH DIGITAL DISINFORMATION; 2) EXAMINED USERSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ SOCIAL MEDIA ENGAGEMENT AND INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS TOWARD RISK AS ANTECEDENTS OF TPP; AND LASTLY, 3) TESTED TPP OF FAKE NEWS UNDER A CONTEXT OF COVID-19 OUTBREAK, AN UNCERTAIN SITUATION FLOODED WITH BASELESS NEWS AND INFORMATION. AN ONLINE SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED ON 871 RESPONDENTS VIA AMAZON MECHANICAL TURK. AS A RESULT, WE FOUND THAT IN THE CONTEXT OF COVID-19, SOCIAL MEDIA ENGAGEMENT 1) DIRECTLY INCREASED TPP; AND 2) INDIRECTLY INCREASED TPP VIA SELF-EFFICACY AND PERCEIVED KNOWLEDGE. HOWEVER, NEGATIVE AFFECT FAILED TO MEDIATE A POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COMMUNAL ENGAGEMENT AND TPP, AS THE RESPONDENTS RATED THEMSELVES MORE ATTENTIVE TO FAKE NEWS THAN ARE OTHERS. THEREFORE, THE FACT THAT SOCIAL MEDIA DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY PROVOKED HIGHER TPP IMPLICATES THAT A POTENTIAL HARM OF SOCIAL MEDIA IS NOT CONFINED TO A RUMOR MILL THAT PROPAGATES FALSE STORIES, AS WIDELY RECOGNIZED, BUT CAN FURTHER EXTEND TO AN ECHO CHAMBER TO CULTIVATE A SLANTED BELIEF THAT HE OR SHE IS FAKE-NEWS-PROOF.

196,YOUTUBE AS A SOURCE OF INFORMATION ON BREAST CANCER IN THE ARAB WORLD,"BACKGROUND: THE GENERAL POPULATION IS INCREASINGLY USING YOUTUBE AS A SOURCE OF INFORMATION ON BREAST CANCER, THE MOST FREQUENT CANCER AMONG WOMEN. ARABS ARE THE MOST INTERESTED POPULATION IN BREAST CANCER ON YOUTUBE. THE TRANSMISSION OF ACCURATE INFORMATION IS IMPORTANT TO REDUCE MORTALITY RATES. THIS CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY AIMS TO EVALUATE BREAST CANCER VIDEOS ON YOUTUBE IN THE ARAB WORLD. METHODS: A YOUTUBE SEARCH FOR Ã¢â‚¬Å“BREAST CANCERÃ¢â‚¬Â IN ARABIC WAS PERFORMED. THE MOST VIEWED 60 VIDEOS INCLUDED WERE EVALUATED FOR GLOBAL QUALITY (GQS SCORE), RELIABILITY (MODIFIED DISCERN SCORE), CONTENT (CONTENT SCORE), AND MISLEADING CLAIMS. RECORDED AND CALCULATED DATA INCLUDED VIEWS, DURATION, VIDEOS POWER INDEX, AND VIEWERSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ INTERACTION. SOURCES FROM LEGAL PERSONS (GOVERNMENTS, UNIVERSITIES, TV CHANNELS, PHYSICIANSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ GROUPS), AND BLOGS (ONLINE HEALTH CHANNELS, INDIVIDUALS) WERE CATEGORIZED. RESULTS: THE MEDIAN GLOBAL QUALITY (3/5), RELIABILITY (2/5), AND CONTENT SCORES (4/11) WERE OVERALL LOW. MISLEADING INFORMATION WAS FOUND IN 42% OF THE VIDEOS. ALTHOUGH VIDEOS UPLOADED BY LEGAL PERSONS WERE LESS POPULAR (163,454 VS 327,488 VIEWS), THEY HOSTED MORE PHYSICIANS (52% VS 15%), WERE LESS MISLEADING (15% VS 64%), COVERED MORE CONTENT, AND WERE OF HIGHER GLOBAL QUALITY AND RELIABILITY THAN VIDEOS UPLOADED BY BLOGS [P < 0.05]. WHILE THE TOPIC OF SYMPTOMS (55%) WAS DISCUSSED THE MOST, GENETIC COUNSELING (13%) AND PREVENTION (20%) WERE THE LEAST MENTIONED. CONCLUSIONS: YOUTUBE IS POORLY INFORMATIONAL AND INACCURATE ON BREAST CANCER IN THE ARAB WORLD WHERE IT IS HIGHLY USED. ALTHOUGH VIDEOS UPLOADED BY LEGAL PERSONS TEND TO BE MORE ADEQUATE, THEY ARE OF LOWER POPULARITY. GOVERNMENTS AND PHYSICIANS ARE ENCOURAGED TO UPLOAD MORE INTELLIGIBLY INFORMATIONAL VIDEOS, GUIDE THE POPULATION TO RELIABLE SOURCES, AND SUPPORT REGULATIONS.

199,BREAST CANCER ON SOCIAL MEDIA A QUALIQUANTITATIVE STUDY ON THE CREDIBILITY AND CONTENT TYPE OF THE MOST SHARED NEWS STORIES,"BACKGROUND: FEMALE BREAST CANCER WAS THE MOST DIAGNOSED CANCER IN 2020, WITH MORE THAN TWO MILLION NEW CASES WORLDWIDE. ACCESS TO SCIENTIFICALLY CORRECT INFORMATION CAN ASSIST PATIENTS IN EARLY DETECTION OR PREVENTION OF THE DISEASE. HOWEVER, MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES (SNSS) ABOUT BREAST CANCER CAN BE PROPAGATED RAPIDLY, POSING A THREAT TO HEALTH COMMUNICATION EFFORTS. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO ANALYSE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MOST SHARED NEWS STORIES REFERENCING THE DISEASE THAT CIRCULATED ON SNSS, INCLUDING THE CREDIBILITY OF THIS CONTENT. METHODS: THIS IS AN EXPLORATORY QUALI-QUANTITATIVE STUDY. DATA COLLECTION WAS CONDUCTED BETWEEN JUNE 2019 AND JUNE 2020. WE PERFORMED STATISTICAL AND CONTENT ANALYSIS OF THE STORIES THAT HAD AT LEAST 1,000 TOTAL SHARES. EACH STORY WAS CLASSIFIED IN ACCORDANCE TO THE FOLLOWING ASPECTS: CREDIBILITY; TYPE OF RUMOUR; SOURCE; CONTENT TYPE; MENTIONS PREVENTION OR EARLY DETECTION/SCREENING EXAMS. RESULTS: THE ABUNDANCE OF NEWS STORIES IN OUR SAMPLE (N = 1,594) WERE NOT CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO THEIR CREDIBILITY, AS THEY DO NOT ADDRESS SCIENCE, RISK FACTORS, PREVENTION, TREATMENT, OR OTHER ASPECTS WHICH CAN BE ASSESSED FOR SCIENTIFIC ACCURACY. HOWEVER, CONTENT CLASSIFIED AS Ã¢â‚¬Å“RUMOURSÃ¢â‚¬Â ARE 3.29 TIMES MORE SHARED THAN THOSE CONSIDERED SCIENTIFICALLY CORRECT. REGARDING CONTENT TYPE, MOST STORIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS Ã¢â‚¬ËœREAL-LIFE STORYÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ OR Ã¢â‚¬ËœSOLIDARITYÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (67.69%). IN OUR SAMPLE, 5.08% OF THE TOTAL COMMENT ON PREVENTION AND 19.7% REFERENCE EARLY DETECTION. CONCLUSION: WE CONSIDER IT CAN BE A GOOD STRATEGY, IN SNSS, TO COMBINE CONTENT OF GREATER POPULARITY, SUCH AS REAL-LIFE STORIES, WITH SUBJECTS THAT CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN A PATIENTÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S LIFE, SUCH AS EARLY DETECTION, BREAST CANCER SYMPTOMS AND DISEASE PREVENTION STRATEGIES.

204,COMPARING INFORMATION DIFFUSION MECHANISMS BY MATCHING ON CASCADE SIZE,"DO SOME TYPES OF INFORMATION SPREAD FASTER, BROADER, OR FURTHER THAN OTHERS? TO UNDERSTAND HOW INFORMATION DIFFUSIONS DIFFER, SCHOLARS COMPARE STRUCTURAL PROPERTIES OF THE PATHS TAKEN BY CONTENT AS IT SPREADS THROUGH A NETWORK, STUDYING SO-CALLED CASCADES. COMMONLY STUDIED CASCADE PROPERTIES INCLUDE THE REACH, DEPTH, BREADTH, AND SPEED OF PROPAGATION. DRAWING CONCLUSIONS FROM STATISTICAL DIFFERENCES IN THESE PROPERTIES CAN BE CHALLENGING, AS MANY PROPERTIES ARE DEPENDENT. IN THIS WORK, WE DEMONSTRATE THE ESSENTIALITY OF CONTROLLING FOR CASCADE SIZES WHEN STUDYING STRUCTURAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN COLLECTIONS OF CASCADES. WE FIRST REVISIT TWO DATASETS FROMNOTABLE RECENT STUDIES OF ONLINE DIFFUSION THAT REPORTED CONTENT-SPECIFIC DIFFERENCES IN CASCADE TOPOLOGY: AN EXHAUSTIVE CORPUS OF TWITTER CASCADES FOR VERIFIED TRUE- OR FALSE-NEWS CONTENT BY VOSOUGHI ET AL. [S. VOSOUGHI, D. ROY, S. ARAL. SCIENCE 359, 1146-1151 (2018)] AND A COMPARISON OF TWITTER CASCADES OF VIDEOS, PICTURES, NEWS, AND PETITIONS BY GOEL ET AL. [S. GOEL, A. ANDERSON, J. HOFMAN, D. J. WATTS. MANAGE. SCI. 62, 180-196 (2016)]. USING METHODS THAT CONTROL FOR JOINT CASCADE STATISTICS, WE FIND THAT FOR FALSE- AND TRUE-NEWS CASCADES, THE REPORTED STRUCTURAL DIFFERENCES CAN ALMOST ENTIRELY BE EXPLAINED BY FALSE-NEWS CASCADES BEING LARGER. FOR VIDEOS, IMAGES, NEWS, AND PETITIONS, STRUCTURAL DIFFERENCES PERSIST WHEN CONTROLLING FOR SIZE. STUDYING CLASSICAL MODELS OF DIFFUSION, WE THEN GIVE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH DIFFERENCES IN STRUCTURAL PROPERTIES UNDER DIFFERENT MODELS DO OR DO NOT REDUCE TO DIFFERENCES IN SIZE. OUR FINDINGS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING TRUE- AND FALSENEWS DIFFUSION BEING QUITE SIMILAR, DIFFERING PRIMARILY IN THE BASIC INFECTIOUSNESS OF THEIR SPREADING PROCESS.

206,COVID19 VACCINE HESITANCY ON SOCIAL MEDIA BUILDING A PUBLIC TWITTER DATA SET OF ANTIVACCINE CONTENT VACCINE MISINFORMATION AND CONSPIRACIES,"BACKGROUND: FALSE CLAIMS ABOUT COVID-19 VACCINES CAN UNDERMINE PUBLIC TRUST IN ONGOING VACCINATION CAMPAIGNS, POSING A THREAT TO GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH. MISINFORMATION ORIGINATING FROM VARIOUS SOURCES HAS BEEN SPREADING ON THE WEB SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. ANTIVACCINE ACTIVISTS HAVE ALSO BEGUN TO USE PLATFORMS SUCH AS TWITTER TO PROMOTE THEIR VIEWS. TO PROPERLY UNDERSTAND THE PHENOMENON OF VACCINE HESITANCY THROUGH THE LENS OF SOCIAL MEDIA, IT IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO GATHER THE RELEVANT DATA. OBJECTIVE: IN THIS PAPER, WE DESCRIBE A DATA SET OF TWITTER POSTS AND TWITTER ACCOUNTS THAT PUBLICLY EXHIBIT A STRONG ANTIVACCINE STANCE. THE DATA SET IS MADE AVAILABLE TO THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY VIA OUR AVAXTWEETS DATA SET GITHUB REPOSITORY. WE CHARACTERIZE THE COLLECTED ACCOUNTS IN TERMS OF PROMINENT HASHTAGS, SHARED NEWS SOURCES, AND MOST LIKELY POLITICAL LEANING. METHODS: WE STARTED THE ONGOING DATA COLLECTION ON OCTOBER 18, 2020, LEVERAGING THE TWITTER STREAMING APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE (API) TO FOLLOW A SET OF SPECIFIC ANTIVACCINE-RELATED KEYWORDS. THEN, WE COLLECTED THE HISTORICAL TWEETS OF THE SET OF ACCOUNTS THAT ENGAGED IN SPREADING ANTIVACCINATION NARRATIVES BETWEEN OCTOBER 2020 AND DECEMBER 2020, LEVERAGING THE ACADEMIC TRACK TWITTER API. THE POLITICAL LEANING OF THE ACCOUNTS WAS ESTIMATED BY MEASURING THE POLITICAL BIAS OF THE MEDIA OUTLETS THEY SHARED. RESULTS: WE GATHERED TWO CURATED TWITTER DATA COLLECTIONS AND MADE THEM PUBLICLY AVAILABLE: (1) A STREAMING KEYWORD-CENTERED DATA COLLECTION WITH MORE THAN 1.8 MILLION TWEETS, AND (2) A HISTORICAL ACCOUNT-LEVEL DATA COLLECTION WITH MORE THAN 135 MILLION TWEETS. THE ACCOUNTS ENGAGED IN THE ANTIVACCINATION NARRATIVES LEAN TO THE RIGHT (CONSERVATIVE) DIRECTION OF THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM. THE VACCINE HESITANCY IS FUELED BY MISINFORMATION ORIGINATING FROM WEBSITES WITH ALREADY QUESTIONABLE CREDIBILITY. CONCLUSIONS: THE VACCINE-RELATED MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA MAY EXACERBATE THE LEVELS OF VACCINE HESITANCY, HAMPERING PROGRESS TOWARD VACCINE-INDUCED HERD IMMUNITY, AND COULD POTENTIALLY INCREASE THE NUMBER OF INFECTIONS RELATED TO NEW COVID-19 VARIANTS. FOR THESE REASONS, UNDERSTANDING VACCINE HESITANCY THROUGH THE LENS OF SOCIAL MEDIA IS OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE. BECAUSE DATA ACCESS IS THE FIRST OBSTACLE TO ATTAIN THIS GOAL, WE PUBLISHED A DATA SET THAT CAN BE USED IN STUDYING ANTIVACCINE MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND ENABLE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF VACCINE HESITANCY.

212,THE NETWORKED CONTEXT OF COVID19 MISINFORMATION INFORMATIONAL HOMOGENEITY ON YOUTUBE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC,"DURING THE CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 (COVID-19) PANDEMIC, THE VIDEO-SHARING PLATFORM YOUTUBE HAS BEEN SERVING AS AN ESSENTIAL INSTRUMENT TO WIDELY DISTRIBUTE NEWS RELATED TO THE GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS AND TO ALLOW USERS TO DISCUSS THE NEWS WITH EACH OTHER IN THE COMMENT SECTIONS. ALONG WITH THESE ENHANCED OPPORTUNITIES OF TECHNOLOGY-BASED COMMUNICATION, THERE IS AN OVERABUNDANCE OF INFORMATION AND, IN MANY CASES, MISINFORMATION ABOUT CURRENT EVENTS. IN TIMES OF A PANDEMIC, THE SPREAD OF MISINFORMATION CAN HAVE DIRECT DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS, POTENTIALLY INFLUENCING CITIZENS' BEHAVIORAL DECISIONS (E.G., TO NOT SOCIALLY DISTANCE) AND PUTTING COLLECTIVE HEALTH AT RISK. MISINFORMATION COULD BE ESPECIALLY HARMFUL IF IT IS DISTRIBUTED IN ISOLATED NEWS COCOONS THAT HOMOGENEOUSLY PROVIDE MISINFORMATION IN THE ABSENCE OF CORRECTIONS OR MERE ACCURATE INFORMATION. THE PRESENT STUDY ANALYZES DATA GATHERED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC (JANUARYÃ¢â‚¬â€œMARCH 2020) AND FOCUSES ON THE NETWORK STRUCTURE OF YOUTUBE VIDEOS AND THEIR COMMENTS TO UNDERSTAND THE LEVEL OF INFORMATIONAL HOMOGENEITY ASSOCIATED WITH MISINFORMATION ON COVID-19 AND ITS EVOLUTION OVER TIME. THIS STUDY COMBINED MACHINE LEARNING AND NETWORK ANALYTIC APPROACHES. RESULTS INDICATE THAT NODES (EITHER INDIVIDUAL USERS OR CHANNELS) THAT SPREAD MISINFORMATION WERE USUALLY INTEGRATED IN HETEROGENEOUS DISCUSSION NETWORKS, PREDOMINANTLY INVOLVING CONTENT OTHER THAN MISINFORMATION. THIS PATTERN REMAINED STABLE OVER TIME. FINDINGS ARE DISCUSSED IN LIGHT OF THE COVID-19 Ã¢â‚¬Å“INFODEMICÃ¢â‚¬Â AND THE FRAGMENTATION OF INFORMATION NETWORKS.

215,ONLINE RUMOR PROPAGATION OF SOCIAL MEDIA ON NIMBY CONFLICT TEMPORAL PATTERNS FRAMEWORKS AND RUMORMONGERS,"THE RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF SOCIAL MEDIA HAS ACCELERATED THE ONLINE RUMOR PROPAGATION, MAKING SOCIAL CONFLICTS MORE INTENSE DURING THE DEVELOPMENT OF NIMBY FACILITIES. THE Ã¢â‚¬Å“FAKE NEWSÃ¢â‚¬Â ISSUE IS NOT NEW, AS THE CONSEQUENCES WILL BE AMPLIFIED WHEN THE FAKERY SPREADS ON SOCIAL MEDIA AS ONLINE RUMORS. HOWEVER, FEW STUDIES HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKEN ON THE ONLINE PUBLIC OPINION, ESPECIALLY THE RUMOR PROPAGATION ON NIMBYISM. THIS STUDY COLLECTS DATA RELATED TO THE ANTI-PX DEMONSTRATION IN MAOMING CITY IN 2014 ON THE WEIBO PLATFORM. TO FORM THE RUMOR TEXT LIBRARY, QUALITATIVE RESEARCH METHOD IS ADOPTED TO ENCODE THE COLLECTED DATA. BASED ON THE SOCIAL AMPLIFICATION OF RISK FRAMEWORK, THREE SUB-FRAMEWORKS ARE PROPOSED IN THIS STUDY AND STATISTICAL METHOD IS USED TO ANALYZE THE TOPICS OF RUMORS. MEANWHILE, THE TEXTUAL CONTENT ANALYSIS AND IMPACT FACTOR ANALYSIS IS EMPLOYED TO EXAMINE THE SEMANTIC FEATURES OF RUMOR TEXTS AND THE KEY ROLE OF RUMOR-MONGERS RESPECTIVELY. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THERE ARE THREE MAIN PROPAGATION LIFECYCLES OF RUMORS WHILE THE TOPICS OF RUMORS VARY ACCORDING TO THE CYCLE. RUMORS BELONGING TO EACH FRAMEWORK HAVE DIVERSE TREND AND THE ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK IS DOMINANT THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS. Ã¢â‚¬Å“INDIVIDUALSÃ¢â‚¬Â AND Ã¢â‚¬Å“ELITESÃ¢â‚¬Â ARE THE MAIN FORCE OF RUMOR SPREADING, AND Ã¢â‚¬Å“MEDIA PRACTITIONERSÃ¢â‚¬Â ARE THE OPINION LEADERS. THESE FINDINGS ARE USEFUL FOR GOVERNMENTS TO ESTABLISH A RUMOR DETECTION SYSTEM SO THAT OFFICIAL INFORMATION CAN BE RELEASED AND RUMORS CAN BE REFUTED WITHOUT DELAY. MEANWHILE, THE COOPERATION WITH THE OPINION LEADERS IN ONLINE RUMOR PROPAGATION SHOULD BE STRENGTHENED. IN ADDITION, A SCIENTIFIC POPULARIZATION AND TIMELY NOTIFICATION OF PROJECT PROGRESS IS RECOMMENDED PRIOR TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF NIMBY FACILITY.

221,AN EMPIRICAL APPROACH TO UNDERSTANDING USERS FAKE NEWS IDENTIFICATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA,"PURPOSE: DURING THE PAST FEW YEARS, THE RISE IN SOCIAL MEDIA USE FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES IN THE ABSENCE OF ADEQUATE CONTROL MECHANISMS HAS LED TO GROWING CONCERNS ABOUT THE RELIABILITY OF THE INFORMATION IN CIRCULATION AND INCREASED THE PRESENCE OF FAKE NEWS. WHILE THIS TOPIC HAS RECENTLY GAINED RESEARCHERS' ATTENTION, VERY LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT USERS' FAKE NEWS IDENTIFICATION BEHAVIOR. HENCE, THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO UNDERSTAND THE FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO INDIVIDUALS' IDENTIFICATION OF FAKE NEWS ON SOCIAL MEDIA. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: THIS STUDY EMPLOYS A QUANTITATIVE APPROACH AND PROPOSES A BEHAVIORAL MODEL THAT EXPLORES THE FACTORS INFLUENCING USERS' IDENTIFICATION OF FAKE NEWS ON SOCIAL MEDIA. IT RELIES ON DATA COLLECTED FROM A SAMPLE OF 211 SOCIAL MEDIA USERS WHICH IS TESTED USING SEM. FINDINGS: THE FINDINGS SHOW THAT EXPERTISE IN SOCIAL MEDIA USE AND VERIFICATION BEHAVIOR HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON FAKE NEWS IDENTIFICATION, WHILE TRUST IN SOCIAL MEDIA AS AN INFORMATION CHANNEL DECREASES THIS IDENTIFICATION BEHAVIOR. FURTHERMORE, RESULTS ESTABLISH THE MEDIATING ROLE OF SOCIAL MEDIA INFORMATION TRUST AND VERIFICATION BEHAVIOR. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: THE PRESENT STUDY ENHANCES OUR UNDERSTANDING OF SOCIAL MEDIA USERS' FAKE NEWS IDENTIFICATION BY PRESENTING A BEHAVIORAL MODEL. IT IS ONE OF THE FEW THAT FOCUSES ON THE INDIVIDUAL AND ARGUES THAT BY IDENTIFYING THE FACTORS THAT REINFORCE USERS' FAKE NEWS IDENTIFICATION BEHAVIOR ON SOCIAL MEDIA, THIS TYPE OF MISINFORMATION CAN BE REDUCED.

230,FAKE NEWS DISCOURSES AN EXPLORATION OF RUSSIAN AND PERSIAN TWEETS,"THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE STRATEGIC USE OF 'FAKE NEWS' DISCOURSES IN NONDEMOCRATIC CONTEXTS USING A MIXED-METHODS APPROACH GROUNDED IN SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS AND DISCOURSE THEORY. IN CONTEXTS SUCH AS RUSSIA AND IRAN, WHERE THE OPPOSITION GENERALLY DOES NOT HAVE UNRESTRICTED ACCESS TO THE POLITICAL PUBLIC SPHERE, SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS SERVE TO INFLUENCE DISCOURSES. GIVEN THE PREVALENCE OF FAKE NEWS DISCOURSES, PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE ALREADY FOCUSED EXTENSIVELY ON THE POLITICAL ELITE AND THEIR USE OF THIS DISCOURSE WITHIN WESTERN OR ANGLO-AMERICAN CONTEXTS, AND ON THE TYPOLOGIES OF 'FAKE NEWS'. OUR FINDINGS ADDRESS THIS RESEARCH GAP AND SUGGEST THAT ORDINARY USERS IN NON-WESTERN AND NON-DEMOCRATIC SETTINGS DO NOT DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN 'FAKE NEWS' TYPES. RATHER, THEY EMPLOY THE DISCOURSE AS A MEANS TO STRATEGICALLY DELEGITIMISE AND DISCREDIT THEIR OPPONENTS.

234,IDENTIFYING FALSE HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS HPV VACCINE INFORMATION AND CORRESPONDING RISK PERCEPTIONS FROM TWITTER ADVANCED PREDICTIVE MODELS,"BACKGROUND: THE VACCINATION UPTAKE RATES OF THE HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS (HPV) VACCINE REMAIN LOW DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF HPV VACCINES HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR MORE THAN A DECADE. VACCINE HESITANCY IS IN PART DUE TO FALSE INFORMATION ABOUT HPV VACCINES ON SOCIAL MEDIA. COMBATING FALSE HPV VACCINE INFORMATION IS A REASONABLE STEP TO ADDRESSING VACCINE HESITANCY. OBJECTIVE: GIVEN THE SUBSTANTIAL HARM OF FALSE HPV VACCINE INFORMATION, THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO IDENTIFY FALSE SOCIAL MEDIA MESSAGES BEFORE IT GOES VIRAL. THE GOAL OF THE STUDY IS TO DEVELOP A SYSTEMATIC AND GENERALIZABLE APPROACH TO IDENTIFYING FALSE HPV VACCINE INFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA. METHODS: THIS STUDY USED MACHINE LEARNING AND NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TO DEVELOP A SERIES OF CLASSIFICATION MODELS AND CAUSALITY MINING METHODS TO IDENTIFY AND EXAMINE TRUE AND FALSE HPV VACCINE-RELATED INFORMATION ON TWITTER. RESULTS: WE FOUND THAT THE CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK MODEL OUTPERFORMED ALL OTHER MODELS IN IDENTIFYING TWEETS CONTAINING FALSE HPV VACCINE-RELATED INFORMATION (F SCORE=91.95). WE ALSO DEVELOPED COMPLETELY UNSUPERVISED CAUSALITY MINING MODELS TO IDENTIFY HPV VACCINE CANDIDATE EFFECTS FOR CAPTURING RISK PERCEPTIONS OF HPV VACCINES. FURTHERMORE, WE FOUND THAT FALSE INFORMATION CONTAINED MOSTLY LOSS-FRAMED MESSAGES FOCUSING ON THE POTENTIAL RISK OF VACCINES COVERING A VARIETY OF TOPICS USING MORE DIVERSE VOCABULARY, WHILE TRUE INFORMATION CONTAINED BOTH GAIN- AND LOSS-FRAMED MESSAGES FOCUSING ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF VACCINES COVERING FEWER TOPICS USING RELATIVELY LIMITED VOCABULARY. CONCLUSIONS: OUR RESEARCH DEMONSTRATED THE FEASIBILITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF USING PREDICTIVE MODELS TO IDENTIFY FALSE HPV VACCINE INFORMATION AND ITS RISK PERCEPTIONS ON SOCIAL MEDIA.

247,AN EVALUATION OF THE READABILITY AND CONTENTQUALITY OF PELVIC ORGAN PROLAPSE YOUTUBE TRANSCRIPTS,"OBJECTIVE: TO EVALUATE THE READABILITY, QUALITY, AND ACCURACY OF PELVIC ORGAN PROLAPSE (POP) YOUTUBE TRANSCRIPTS. METHODS: WE ANALYZED THE READABILITY OF WRITTEN TRANSCRIPTS FOR THE FIRST 100 YOUTUBE VIDEOS ABOUT Ã¢â‚¬Å“PELVIC ORGAN PROLAPSE.Ã¢â‚¬Â TRANSCRIPTS WERE EXCLUDED IF THEY LACKED NARRATION IN ENGLISH OR CONTAINED BOTH NO TEXT AND NO AUDIO. READABILITY WAS EVALUATED USING AN ONLINE SOFTWARE (WWW.READABILITYFORMULAS.COM) TO DETERMINE READING GRADE LEVELS. THE QUALITY OF VIDEOS WAS SCORED USING THE DISCERN QUALITY CRITERIA AND THE PATIENT EDUCATION MATERIALS ASSESSMENT TOOL. ACCURACY WAS ASSESSED BY COMPARING CONTENT TO ACCEPTED POP TREATMENT GUIDELINES. RESULTS: THE MEDIAN GRADE LEVEL OF ALL 100 VIDEOS WAS 12.6. HIGH QUALITY TRANSCRIPTS OR TRANSCRIPTS THAT DISCUSS THE BENEFITS, RISK, ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS, AND QUALITY OF LIFE HAD A MEDIAN READABILITY SCORE OF 12.5. TRANSCRIPTS WITH LOW MISINFORMATION (85%) HAD A HIGHER MEDIAN READABILITY INDEX (12.6), THAN TRANSCRIPTS CONTAINING HIGH MISINFORMATION (12.2). MORE THAN 20% OF TRANSCRIPTS DISCUSSED SHARED DECISION-MAKING. THE MEDIAN READABILITY INDEX FOR VIDEOS WITH A HIGH PATIENT EDUCATION MATERIALS ASSESSMENT TOOL SCORE (>75%) FOR UNDERSTANDABILITY AND ACTIONABILITY WERE BOTH 12.6. CONCLUSION: TRANSCRIPTS OF POP YOUTUBE VIDEOS ARE WRITTEN AT DIFFICULT LEVELS WITH MANY TRANSCRIPTS EXCEEDING THE READING CAPABILITIES OF THE AMERICAN POPULATION. THE MAJORITY OF GOOD TRANSCRIPTS OR TRANSCRIPTS WITH HIGH QUALITY CONTENT, LOW MISINFORMATION, SHARED DECISION-MAKING, NO COMMERCIAL BIAS, AND UNDERSTANDABLE AND ACTIONABLE CONTENT WERE WRITTEN AT A HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL OR ABOVE.

BY GROUNDING THE DISCUSSION ON THE AGENDA-BUILDING THEORY, WE THEORIZE THE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG FOUR KEY VARIABLES OF INTEREST, NAMELY, (1) FOREIGN DISINFORMATION THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA, (2) DOMESTIC ONLINE MEDIA FRACTIONALIZATION, (3) GOVERNMENT'S CONTROL OVER CYBERSPACE, AND (4) SOCIAL MEDIA-INDUCED OFFLINE VIOLENCE IN A COUNTRY. A QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS BASED ON PUBLICLY AVAILABLE ARCHIVAL DATA OFFERS SUPPORT FOR OUR RESEARCH MODEL. SPECIFICALLY, OUR FINDINGS INDICATE THAT FOREIGN DISINFORMATION THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA INCREASES SOCIAL MEDIA-INDUCED OFFLINE VIOLENCE IN A COUNTRY BY INCREASING ITS DOMESTIC ONLINE MEDIA FRACTIONALIZATION. FURTHER, OUR RESULTS HIGHLIGHT THAT THE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG FOREIGN DISINFORMATION THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA, SOCIAL MEDIA-INDUCED OFFLINE VIOLENCE, AND DOMESTIC ONLINE MEDIA FRACTIONALIZATION IN A COUNTRY ARE CONTINGENT ON THE GOVERNMENT'S ROLE IN CONTROLLING ITS CYBERSPACE.

274,THE NEGATIVE ROLE OF SOCIAL MEDIA DURING THE COVID19 OUTBREAK,"THE OUTBREAK OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS EXPOSED THE POWER OF SOCIAL MEDIA IN THE DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION. THE CURRENT PANDEMIC HAS HURT NOT ONLY SOCIAL MEDIA USERS BUT ALSO ON STATE'S SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. AS A RESULT, THE PRESENT STUDY SEEKS TO UNDERSTAND THE REASONS FOR USING SOCIAL MEDIA DURING THE COVID 19 PANDEMIC BY SCREENING VARIOUS TOPICS AND ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA, PRIMARILY PSYCHOLOGICAL AND MENTAL EFFECTS. THE STUDY UTILIZED A QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH DESIGN. PARTICIPANTS WERE INDIVIDUALS BETWEEN THE AGE OF TWENTY AND FIFTY. DATA WAS COLLECTED USING A QUESTIONNAIRE SHARED ONLINE TO THE 360 PARTICIPANTS. THE STUDIES' RESPONSES WERE ANALYZED USING DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS AND THE ARITHMETIC PERCENTAGE METHOD USING GRAPHS AND FIGURES. THE STUDY RESULTS REVEALED THAT MANY RESPONDENTS USE SOCIAL MEDIA AS A SOURCE OF INFORMATION, NEWS, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL NOURISHMENT. BESIDES, THE RESULTS INDICATED THAT PARTICIPANTS BELOW 50 YEARS OF AGE USED SOCIAL MEDIA FREQUENTLY. WHATSAPP, TWITTER, AND YOUTUBE WERE THE MOST USED SOCIAL MEDIA SITES AMONG THE PARTICIPANTS. THE FINDINGS INDICATED THAT MOST PARTICIPANTS USED SOCIAL MEDIA AS A SOURCE OF VITAL INFORMATION DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. THE CURRENT STUDY RECOMMENDS THAT GOVERNMENTS AND HEALTH INSTITUTIONS FOCUS ON DEVELOPING ABILITIES TO RESPOND SIMULTANEOUSLY TO MISINFORMATION CASES. THIS STUDY HAS FACILITATED MORE KNOWLEDGE INTO THE USES OF SOCIAL MEDIA IN TIMES OF HEALTH CRISES. THE STUDY ACTS AS A BLUEPRINT TO PREPARE THE WORLD FOR MANAGING SOCIAL MEDIA INFORMATION SHARING IN THE FUTURE. Ã‚Â© 2021 WITPRESS.

347,DIFFERENT TYPES OF COVID19 MISINFORMATION HAVE DIFFERENT EMOTIONAL VALENCE ON TWITTER,"THE SPREADING OF COVID-19 MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA COULD HAVE SEVERE CONSEQUENCES ON PEOPLE'S BEHAVIOR. IN THIS PAPER, WE INVESTIGATED THE EMOTIONAL EXPRESSION OF MISINFORMATION RELATED TO THE COVID-19 CRISIS ON TWITTER AND WHETHER EMOTIONAL VALENCE DIFFERED DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF MISINFORMATION. WE COLLECTED 17,463,220 ENGLISH TWEETS WITH 76 COVID-19-RELATED HASHTAGS FOR MARCH 2020. USING GOOGLE FACT CHECK EXPLORER API WE IDENTIFIED 226 UNIQUE COVID-19 FALSE STORIES FOR MARCH 2020. THESE WERE CLUSTERED INTO SIX TYPES OF MISINFORMATION (CURES, VIRUS, VACCINE, POLITICS, CONSPIRACY THEORIES, AND OTHER). APPLYING THE 226 CLASSIFIERS TO THE TWITTER SAMPLE WE IDENTIFIED 690,004 TWEETS. INSTEAD OF RUNNING THE SENTIMENT ON ALL TWEETS WE MANUALLY CODED A RANDOM SUBSET OF 100 TWEETS FOR EACH CLASSIFIER TO INCREASE THE VALIDITY, REDUCING THE DATASET TO 2,097 TWEETS. WE FOUND THAT ONLY A MINOR PART OF THE ENTIRE DATASET WAS RELATED TO MISINFORMATION. ALSO, MISINFORMATION IN GENERAL DOES NOT LEAN TOWARDS A CERTAIN EMOTIONAL VALENCE. HOWEVER, LOOKING AT COMPARISONS OF EMOTIONAL VALENCE FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF MISINFORMATION UNCOVERED THAT MISINFORMATION RELATED TO Ã¢â‚¬Å“VIRUSÃ¢â‚¬Â AND Ã¢â‚¬Å“CONSPIRACYÃ¢â‚¬Â HAD A MORE NEGATIVE VALENCE THAN Ã¢â‚¬Å“CURES,Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬Å“VACCINE,Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬Å“POLITICS,Ã¢â‚¬Â AND Ã¢â‚¬Å“OTHER.Ã¢â‚¬Â KNOWING FROM EXISTING STUDIES THAT NEGATIVE MISINFORMATION SPREADS FASTER, THIS DEMONSTRATES THAT FILTERING FOR MISINFORMATION TYPE IS FRUITFUL AND INDICATES THAT A FOCUS ON Ã¢â‚¬Å“VIRUSÃ¢â‚¬Â AND Ã¢â‚¬Å“CONSPIRACYÃ¢â‚¬Â COULD BE ONE STRATEGY IN COMBATING MISINFORMATION. AS EMOTIONAL CONTEXTS AFFECT MISINFORMATION SPREADING, THE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT EMOTIONAL VALENCE FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF MISINFORMATION WILL HELP TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE SPREADING AND CONSEQUENCES OF MISINFORMATION.

353,HUNTING CONSPIRACY THEORIES DURING THE COVID19 PANDEMIC,"THE FEAR OF THE UNKNOWN COMBINED WITH THE ISOLATION GENERATED BY COVID-19 HAS CREATED A FERTILE ENVIRONMENT FOR STRONG DISINFORMATION, OTHERWISE KNOWN AS CONSPIRACY THEORIES, TO FLOURISH. BECAUSE CONSPIRACY THEORIES OFTEN CONTAIN A KERNEL OF TRUTH AND FEATURE A STRONG ADVERSARIAL Ã¢â‚¬Å“OTHER,Ã¢â‚¬Â THEY SERVE AS THE PERFECT VEHICLE FOR MALIGNED ACTORS TO USE IN INFLUENCE CAMPAIGNS. TO EXPLORE THE IMPORTANCE OF CONSPIRACIES IN THE SPREAD OF DIS-/MIS-INFORMATION, WE PROPOSE THE USAGE OF STATE-OF-THE-ART, TUNED LANGUAGE MODELS TO CLASSIFY TWEETS AS CONSPIRATORIAL OR NOT. THIS MODEL IS BASED ON THE BIDIRECTIONAL ENCODER REPRESENTATIONS FROM TRANSFORMERS (BERT) MODEL DEVELOPED BY GOOGLE RESEARCHERS. THE CLASSIFICATION METHOD EXPEDITES ANALYSIS BY AUTOMATING A PROCESS THAT IS CURRENTLY DONE MANUALLY (IDENTIFYING TWEETS THAT PROMOTE CONSPIRACY THEORIES). WE IDENTIFIED COVID-19 ORIGIN CONSPIRACY THEORY TWEETS USING THIS METHOD AND THEN USED SOCIAL CYBERSECURITY METHODS TO ANALYZE COMMUNITIES, SPREADERS, AND CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DIFFERENT ORIGIN-RELATED CONSPIRACY THEORY NARRATIVES. WE FOUND THAT TWEETS ABOUT CONSPIRACY THEORIES WERE SUPPORTED BY NEWS SITES WITH LOW FACT-CHECKING SCORES AND AMPLIFIED BY BOTS WHO WERE MORE LIKELY TO LINK TO PROMINENT TWITTER USERS THAN IN NON-CONSPIRACY TWEETS. WE ALSO FOUND DIFFERENT PATTERNS IN CONSPIRACY VS. NON-CONSPIRACY CONVERSATIONS IN TERMS OF HASHTAG USAGE, IDENTITY, AND COUNTRY OF ORIGIN.

THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THE STUDY IS TO INVESTIGATE THE SALIENT FEATURES OF HEALTH MISINFORMATION AND TO DEVELOP A TOOL OF FEATURES TO HELP USERS AND SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES IDENTIFY HEALTH MISINFORMATION. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: EMPIRICAL DATA INCLUDE 1,168 PIECES OF HEALTH INFORMATION THAT WERE COLLECTED FROM WECHAT, A DOMINANT SMS IN CHINA, AND THE OBTAINED DATA WERE ANALYZED THROUGH A PROCESS OF OPEN CODING, AXIAL CODING AND SELECTIVE CODING. THEN CHI-SQUARE TEST AND ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE (ANOVA) WERE ADOPTED TO IDENTIFY SALIENT FEATURES OF HEALTH MISINFORMATION. FINDINGS: THE FINDINGS SHOW THAT THE FEATURES OF HEALTH MISINFORMATION ON SMSS INVOLVE SURFACE FEATURES, SEMANTIC FEATURES AND SOURCE FEATURES, AND THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN THE FEATURES OF HEALTH MISINFORMATION BETWEEN DIFFERENT TOPICS. IN ADDITION, THE LIST OF FEATURES WAS DEVELOPED TO IDENTIFY HEALTH MISINFORMATION ON SMSS. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: THIS STUDY RAISES AWARENESS OF THE KEY FEATURES OF HEALTH MISINFORMATION ON SMSS.

FAKE NEWS DETECTION AND IDENTIFYING ITS PROPAGATION PATH ARE TECHNICALLY VERY CHALLENGING. IN THIS WORK, WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED A NOVEL METHOD TO LEARN DISCRIMINATIVE FEATURES FROM TWEETS CONTENT, FACEBOOK POSTS AND FOLLOWED THEIR NON-SEQUENTIAL PROPAGATION STRUCTURE, AND GENERATED MORE POWERFUL REPRESENTATIONS FOR IDENTIFYING FAKE NEWS AND ITS PROPAGATION BY CONSTRUCTING A SOCIAL NETWORK GRAPH. WE PROPOSED LEVEL ORDER TRAVERSAL UP TO THREE LEVELS BASED ON TOP-DOWN TREE STRUCTURED NETWORKS FOR FAKE PROPAGATION LEARNING AND DETECTED THE NEIGHBORS OF THE FAKE NEWS SOURCE AND REMOVED THEM FROM THE NETWORK WHICH NATURALLY CONFIRMS THE REDUCTION OF THEIR PROPAGATION. WE HAVE CONSIDERED THE BENCHMARK DATA SET LIAR AND USED POLITIFACT USER DATA FOR OUR RESEARCH WORK.

THROUGH BINARY LOGISTIC REGRESSION ANALYSIS, IT WAS FOUND THAT FREQUENT VISITS TO INSTAGRAM, SHARING A POLITICAL POST OF A FRIEND, AND LIKING A POST OF A POLITICAL PARTY COULD INCREASE THE SUSCEPTIBILITY OF STUDENTS TO FAKE NEWS. ON THE OTHER HAND, SHARING THE POST OF A POLITICAL PARTY, AND SEEKING THE OPINION OF EXPERTS COULD DECREASE THE SUSCEPTIBILITY OF STUDENTS TO FAKE NEWS.

378,NAVIGATING THE MAZE DEEPFAKES COGNITIVE ABILITY AND SOCIAL MEDIA NEWS SKEPTICISM,"THE EARLY APPREHENSIONS ABOUT HOW DEEPFAKES (ALSO DEEP FAKES) COULD BE WEAPONIZED FOR SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PURPOSES ARE NOW COMING TO PASS. THIS STUDY IS ONE OF THE FIRST TO EXAMINE THE SOCIAL IMPACT OF DEEPFAKES. USING AN ONLINE SURVEY SAMPLE IN THE UNITED STATES, THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CITIZEN CONCERNS REGARDING DEEPFAKES, EXPOSURE TO DEEPFAKES, INADVERTENT SHARING OF DEEPFAKES, THE COGNITIVE ABILITY OF INDIVIDUALS, AND SOCIAL MEDIA NEWS SKEPTICISM. RESULTS SUGGEST THAT DEEPFAKES EXPOSURE AND CONCERNS ARE POSITIVELY RELATED TO SOCIAL MEDIA NEWS SKEPTICISM. IN CONTRAST, THOSE WHO FREQUENTLY RELY ON SOCIAL MEDIA AS A NEWS PLATFORM ARE LESS SKEPTICAL. HIGHER COGNITIVE ABLED INDIVIDUALS ARE MORE SKEPTICAL OF NEWS ON SOCIAL MEDIA. THE MODERATION FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT AMONG THOSE WHO ARE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT DEEPFAKES, INADVERTENTLY SHARING A DEEPFAKE IS ASSOCIATED WITH HEIGHTENED SKEPTICISM. HOWEVER, THESE PATTERNS ARE MORE PRONOUNCED AMONG LOW THAN HIGH COGNITIVE INDIVIDUALS.

381,THE HUMAN COMPONENT IN SOCIAL MEDIA AND FAKE NEWS THE PERFORMANCE OF UK OPINION LEADERS ON TWITTER DURING THE BREXIT CAMPAIGN,"EVER SINCE DAVID CAMERON ANNOUNCED THE UKÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S EU REFERENDUM IN FEBRUARY 2016, DISCUSSIONS ABOUT FAKE NEWS DURING THE BREXIT CAMPAIGN HAVE BEEN THRIVING AND SPARKING DEBATES ON THE ROLE OF SOCIAL MEDIA IN THE RUN-UP TO BREXIT. SO FAR, RESEARCH ON THIS TOPIC HAS MAINLY FOCUSED ON THE AUTOMATIC SPREAD OF FALSE INFORMATION, THROUGH BOTS, FOR EXAMPLE. BUILDING ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT POLITICAL LEADERS ACCOUNTED FOR FAKE NEWS AS WELL, MY ANALYSIS ADDS A HUMAN COMPONENT: I SCREENED MORE THAN 1400 TWEETS POSTED BY DAVID CAMERON, JEREMY CORBYN, BORIS JOHNSON AND NIGEL FARAGE DURING THE BREXIT CAMPAIGN. USING FACT-CHECKING PLATFORMS, I VERIFIED EACH LEADERÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S TOP THREE ARGUMENTS FOR REMAIN OR LEAVE. AS THE RESULTS SHOW, SOME POLITICAL LEADERS TURNED OUT TO BE PART OF THE FAKE NEWS EPIDEMIC SURROUNDING BREXIT: JOHNSON AND FARAGE SHARED MULTIPLE ARGUMENTS THAT WERE CLEARLY MISLEADING, WHILE CORBYN AND CAMERON MOSTLY STUCK TO THE FACTS (ALTHOUGH SOME OF THEIR POINTS WERE SPECULATIVE).

382,AN EXPLORATION OF EGYPTIAN FACEBOOK USERS PERCEPTIONS AND BEHAVIOR OF COVID19 MISINFORMATION,"SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS HAVE BECOME AN ESSENTIAL SOURCE OF INFORMATION FOR MANY USERS. THE PURPOSE OF THE CURRENT STUDY IS TO EXPLORE EGYPTIAN SOCIAL MEDIA USERSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ PERCEPTIONS AND BEHAVIOR IN THE CONTEXT OF COVID-19 MISINFORMATION. THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN TWO STAGES; THE FIRST INCLUDED IDENTIFYING AND CATEGORIZING MISINFORMATION SHARED IN THE ARABIC LANGUAGE ON EGYPTIAN SOCIAL MEDIA PAGES, AND THE SECOND STAGE INVOLVED DISTRIBUTING A QUESTIONNAIRE TO CAPTURE THE USERSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ PERCEPTIONS AND BEHAVIOR. THE STUDY UTILIZED A MIXED-METHODS APPROACH TO ACHIEVE THE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES. IN ALL, 1304 QUESTIONNAIRES WERE RETRIEVED. THE FINDINGS OF THE STUDY SHOWED THAT THERE ARE FOUR MAIN TYPES OF MISINFORMATION SHARED ON SOCIAL MEDIA. THE FIRST TYPE IS FALSE CLAIMS ABOUT THE VIRUS OR TREATMENT OF THE VIRUS; THE SECOND IS FALSE INFORMATION ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT; THE THIRD IS FALSE CONTENT IN GENERAL OR MANIPULATED CONTENT, AND THE LAST TYPE IS CONSPIRACY THEORIES. THE FINDINGS ALSO REVEALED THAT GENDER AND EDUCATION AFFECT HOW PEOPLE DEAL WITH AND ACCEPT MISINFORMATION. ADDITIONALLY, IT WAS FOUND THAT THE SPREAD OF COVID-19 MISINFORMATION HAS CAUSED NEGATIVE FEELINGS AMONG THE PARTICIPANTS. THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED ON A SAMPLE OF EGYPTIAN PARTICIPANTS AND EGYPTIAN SOCIAL MEDIA PAGES ON FACEBOOK, HENCE, THE TYPES OF MISINFORMATION AND THE RESULTS MAY DIFFER IN OTHER COUNTRIES, DEPENDING ON THE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM AND OTHER FACTORS THAT MAY PLAY A ROLE IN THE SPREAD OF MISINFORMATION.

385,IDENTIFYING HOW COVID19RELATED MISINFORMATION REACTS TO THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE UK NATIONAL LOCKDOWN AN INTERRUPTED TIMESERIES STUDY,"COVID-19 IS UNIQUE IN THAT IT IS THE FIRST GLOBAL PANDEMIC OCCURRING AMIDST A CROWDED INFORMATION ENVIRONMENT THAT HAS FACILITATED THE PROLIFERATION OF MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA. DANGEROUS MISLEADING NARRATIVES HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO DISRUPT Ã¢â‚¬ËœOFFICIALÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ INFORMATION SHARING AT MAJOR GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCEMENTS. USING AN INTERRUPTED TIME-SERIES DESIGN, WE TEST THE IMPACT OF THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE FIRST UK LOCKDOWN (8Ã¢â‚¬â€œ8.30 P.M. 23 MARCH 2020) ON SHORT-TERM TRENDS OF MISINFORMATION ON TWITTER. WE UTILISE A NOVEL DATASET OF ALL COVID-19-RELATED SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS ON TWITTER FROM THE UK 48 HOURS BEFORE AND 48 HOURS AFTER THE ANNOUNCEMENT (N = 2,531,888). WE FIND THAT WHILE THE NUMBER OF TWEETS INCREASED IMMEDIATELY POST ANNOUNCEMENT, THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF AN INCREASE IN MISINFORMATION-RELATED TWEETS. WE FOUND AN INCREASE IN COVID-19-RELATED BOT ACTIVITY POST-ANNOUNCEMENT. TOPIC MODELLING OF MISINFORMATION TWEETS REVEALED FOUR DISTINCT CLUSTERS: Ã¢â‚¬ËœGOVERNMENT AND POLICYÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœSYMPTOMSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœPUSHING BACK AGAINST MISINFORMATIONÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ AND Ã¢â‚¬ËœCURES AND TREATMENTSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.

386,IDENTIFYING AND CHARACTERIZING SCIENTIFIC AUTHORITYRELATED MISINFORMATION DISCOURSE ABOUT HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE ON TWITTER USING UNSUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING,"THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE TYPES OF MISINFORMATION SPREAD ON TWITTER THAT EVOKES SCIENTIFIC AUTHORITY OR EVIDENCE WHEN MAKING FALSE CLAIMS ABOUT THE ANTIMALARIAL DRUG HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE AS A TREATMENT FOR COVID-19. SPECIFICALLY, WE EXAMINED TWEETS GENERATED AFTER FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP RETWEETED MISINFORMATION ABOUT THE DRUG USING AN UNSUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH CALLED THE BITERM TOPIC MODEL THAT IS USED TO CLUSTER TWEETS INTO MISINFORMATION TOPICS BASED ON TEXTUAL SIMILARITY. THE TOP 10 TWEETS FROM EACH TOPIC CLUSTER WERE CONTENT CODED FOR THREE TYPES OF MISINFORMATION CATEGORIES RELATED TO SCIENTIFIC AUTHORITY: MEDICAL ENDORSEMENTS OF HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE, SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION USED TO SUPPORT HYDROXYCHLOROQUINEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S USE, AND A COMPARISON GROUP THAT INCLUDED SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE OPPOSING HYDROXYCHLOROQUINEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S USE. RESULTS SHOW A MUCH HIGHER VOLUME OF TWEETS FEATURING MEDICAL ENDORSEMENTS AND USE OF SUPPORTIVE SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION COMPARED TO ACCURATE AND UPDATED SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE, THAT MISINFORMATION-RELATED TWEETS PROPAGATED FOR A LONGER TIME FRAME, AND THE MAJORITY OF HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE TWITTER DISCOURSE EXPRESSED POSITIVE VIEWS ABOUT THE DRUG. METADATA FROM TWITTER ACCOUNTS FOUND THAT PROMINENT USERS WITHIN MISINFORMATION DISCOURSE WERE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE MEDIA OR POLITICAL AFFILIATION AND EXPLICITLY EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP. CONVERSELY, PROMINENT ACCOUNTS WITHIN THE SCIENTIFIC OPPOSITION DISCOURSE PRIMARILY CONSISTED OF MEDICAL DOCTORS OR SCIENTISTS BUT HAD FAR LESS INFLUENCE IN THE TWITTER DISCOURSE.

AN ONLINE SAMPLE OF AMERICAN ADULTS FROM AUGUST OF 2019 WAS RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO VIEW TWO SIMULATED FACEBOOK VIDEOS. THE FIRST VIDEO MANIPULATED THE PRESENCE OF NEWS LITERACY CONCEPTS. THE SECOND VIDEO EITHER PROMOTED SUNSCREEN USE OR MADE INACCURATE CLAIMS REGARDING ITS DANGERS; SCROLLING COMMENTS EITHER DEBUNKED OR DID NOT ADDRESS THE SUNSCREEN MISINFORMATION IN THE VIDEO. OUR RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT VIDEO MISINFORMATION HEIGHTENED BELIEFS IN SUNSCREEN MYTHS AND REDUCED ACCEPTANCE OF SUNSCREEN FACTS AND INTENTIONS TO WEAR SUNSCREEN COMPARED TO A PROMOTIONAL VIDEO. REAL-TIME USER CORRECTIONS WERE PARTIALLY SUCCESSFUL IN REDUCING THE EFFECTS OF THE MISINFORMATION VIDEO ON BELIEFS BUT NOT INTENTIONS. ADDITIONALLY, EXPOSURE TO A NEWS LITERACY VIDEO DID NOT INOCULATE PEOPLE TO THE MISINFORMATION.

404,DEEPFAKES ON TWITTER WHICH ACTORS CONTROL THEIR SPREAD,"THE TERM DEEPFAKE WAS FIRST USED IN A REDDIT POST IN 2017 TO REFER TO VIDEOS MANIPULATED USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TECHNIQUES AND SINCE THEN IT IS BECOMING EASIER TO CREATE SUCH FAKE VIDEOS. A RECENT INVESTIGATION BY THE CYBERSECURITY COM-PANY DEEPTRACE IN SEPTEMBER 2019 INDICATED THAT THE NUMBER OF WHAT IS KNOWN AS FAKE VIDEOS HAD DOUBLED IN THE LAST NINE MONTHS AND THAT MOST WERE PORNOGRAPHIC VIDEOS USED AS REVENGE TO HARM MANY WOMEN. THE REPORT ALSO HIGHLIGHTED THE POTENTIAL OF THIS TECHNOLOGY TO BE USED IN POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS SUCH AS IN GABON AND MALAYSIA. IN THIS SENSE, THE PHENOMENON OF DEEPFAKE HAS BECOME A CONCERN FOR GOVERNMENTS BECAUSE IT POSES A SHORT-TERM THREAT NOT ONLY TO POLITICS, BUT ALSO FOR FRAUD OR CYBERBULLYING. THE STARTING POINT OF THIS RESEARCH WAS TWITTERÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S ANNOUNCEMENT OF A CHANGE IN ITS PRO-TOCOLS TO FIGHT FAKE NEWS AND DEEPFAKES. WE HAVE USED THE SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS TECHNIQUE, WITH VISUALIZATION AS A KEY COMPONENT, TO ANALYZE THE CONVERSATION ON TWITTER ABOUT THE DEEPFAKE PHENOMENON. NODEXL WAS USED TO IDENTIFY MAIN ACTORS AND THE NETWORK OF CONNECTIONS BETWEEN ALL THESE ACCOUNTS. IN ADDITION, THE SEMANTIC NETWORKS OF THE TWEETS WERE ANALYZED TO DISCOVER HIDDEN PATTERNS OF MEANING. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT HALF OF THE ACTORS WHO FUNCTION AS BRIDGES IN THE INTERACTIONS THAT SHAPE THE NETWORK ARE JOURNALISTS AND MEDIA, WHICH IS A SIGN OF THE CONCERN THAT THIS SOPHISTICATED FORM OF MANIPULATION GENERATES IN THIS COLLECTIVE.

WE EXAMINED THE EXTENT TO WHICH WHATSAPP USERS MIGHT BE WILLING TO CORRECT THEIR PEERS WHO MIGHT SHARE COVID-19 MISINFORMATION. MATERIALS AND METHODS: WE CONDUCTED A CROSS-SECTIONAL ONLINE SURVEY USING QUALTRICS AMONG 726 BRAZILIAN ADULTS TO IDENTIFY THE TYPES OF SOCIAL CORRECTION BEHAVIORS (SCBS) AND HEALTH AND TECHNOLOGICAL FACTORS THAT SHAPE THE PERFORMANCE OF THESE BEHAVIORS. RESULTS: BRAZIL'S WHATSAPP USERS EXPRESSED MEDIUM TO HIGH LEVELS OF WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE IN SCBS. WE DISCOVERED 3 MODES OF SCBS: CORRECTION TO THE GROUP, CORRECTION TO THE SENDER ONLY, AND PASSIVE OR NO CORRECTION. WHATSAPP USERS WITH LOWER LEVELS OF EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT AND FROM YOUNGER AGE GROUPS WERE LESS INCLINED TO PROVIDE CORRECTIONS. LASTLY, THE PERCEIVED SEVERITY OF COVID-19 AND THE ABILITY TO CRITICALLY EVALUATE A MESSAGE WERE POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING CORRECTIONS TO EITHER THE GROUP OR THE SENDER. DISCUSSION: THE DEMOGRAPHIC ANALYSES POINT TO THE NEED TO STRENGTHEN INFORMATION LITERACY AMONG POPULATION GROUPS THAT ARE YOUNGER WITH LOWER LEVELS OF EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT. THESE EFFORTS COULD FACILITATE INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE GLOBAL FIGHT AGAINST MISINFORMATION BY THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION IN COLLABORATION WITH MEMBER STATES, SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES, AND CIVIL SOCIETY. CONCLUSION: OUR STUDY SUGGESTS THAT BRAZIL'S WHATSAPP USERS MIGHT BE WILLING TO ACTIVELY RESPOND WITH FEEDBACK WHEN EXPOSED TO COVID-19 MISINFORMATION BY THEIR PEERS ON SMALL-WORLD NETWORKS LIKE WHATSAPP GROUPS.

180,FACTORS INFLUENCING THE ACCESSIBILITY AND RELIABILITY OF HEALTH INFORMATION IN THE FACE OF THE COVID19 OUTBREAKA STUDY IN RURAL CHINA,"INTRODUCTION: RURAL RESIDENTS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE LIMITED ACCESS TO RELIABLE HEALTH INFORMATION AND THEREFORE MAY BE AT HIGHER RISKS FOR THE ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS OF THE COVID-19. THE AIM OF THIS RESEARCH IS 2-FOLD: (1) TO EXPLORE THE IMPACTS OF DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS ON THE ACCESSIBILITY OF HEALTH INFORMATION; AND (2) TO ASSESS THE IMPACTS OF INFORMATION CHANNELS ON THE RELIABILITY OF HEALTH INFORMATION ACCESSED BY RURAL RESIDENTS IN CHINA DURING THE COVID-19 OUTBREAK. METHODS: MIXED METHODS RESEARCH WAS PERFORMED TO PROVIDE A RELATIVELY COMPLETE PICTURE ABOUT THE ACCESSIBILITY AND RELIABILITY OF HEALTH INFORMATION IN RURAL CHINA IN THE FACE OF THE COVID-19. A QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH WAS CONDUCTED THROUGH SURVEYING 435 CHINESE RURAL RESIDENTS AND A QUALITATIVE STUDY WAS PERFORMED THROUGH COLLECTING MATERIALS FROM ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR SOCIAL MEDIA APPLICATION (WECHAT) IN CHINA. THE LOGISTIC REGRESSION TECHNIQUES WERE USED TO EXAMINE THE IMPACTS OF DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS ON THE ACCESSIBILITY OF HEALTH INFORMATION. THE CONTENT ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED TO DESCRIBE AND SUMMARIZE QUALITATIVE MATERIALS TO INFORM THE IMPACTS OF INFORMATION CHANNELS ON THE RELIABILITY OF HEALTH INFORMATION. RESULTS: AGE WAS FOUND TO POSITIVELY ASSOCIATE WITH THE ACCESSIBILITY OF HEALTH INFORMATION, WHILE AN OPPOSITE ASSOCIATION WAS FOUND BETWEEN EDUCATION AND THE ACCESSIBILITY OF HEALTH INFORMATION. RURAL RESIDENTS WITH MONTHLY INCOME BETWEEN 3,001 CNY AND 4,000 CNY WERE THE LEAST LIKELY TO ACCESS HEALTH INFORMATION. RURAL RESIDENTS WHO WORKED/STUDIED FROM HOME WERE MORE LIKELY TO ACCESS HEALTH INFORMATION. MEANWHILE, HEALTH INFORMATION TENDED TO BE DERIVED FROM NON-OFFICIAL SOCIAL MEDIA CHANNELS WHERE RUMORS AND UNVERIFIED HEALTH INFORMATION SPREAD FAST, AND THE ELDERLY AND LESS-EDUCATED RURAL RESIDENTS WERE MORE LIKELY TO ACCESS HEALTH MISINFORMATION. CONCLUSIONS: POLICY MAKERS ARE SUGGESTED TO ADOPT EFFICIENT MEASURES TO CONTAIN THE SPREAD OF RUMORS AND UNVERIFIED HEALTH INFORMATION ON NON-OFFICIAL SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS DURING THE OUTBREAK OF A PANDEMIC. MORE EFFORTS SHOULD BE DEVOTED TO ASSIST THE ELDERLY AND LESS-EDUCATED RURAL RESIDENTS TO ACCESS RELIABLE HEALTH INFORMATION IN THE FACE OF A PANDEMIC OUTBREAK.

181,THE INFLUENCE OF THE DEBUNKERS IDENTITY AND EMOTIONAL EXPRESSION ON THE SHARING BEHAVIOR OF DEBUNKING INFORMATION,"OWING TO THE PROLIFERATION OF RUMORS ON SOCIAL MEDIA, IT IS NECESSARY TO DISSEMINATE DEBUNKING INFORMATION TO MINIMIZE THE HARM CAUSED BY THEM. USING CONTENT ANALYSIS, SENTIMENT ANALYSIS, AND REGRESSION ANALYSIS, THIS STUDY EXAMINED THE MEDIATING ROLE OF FOLLOWER COUNT IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE DEBUNKERÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S IDENTITY AND SHARING BEHAVIOR, AND IT EXPLORED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TEXT SENTIMENT OF DEBUNKING INFORMATION AND SHARING BEHAVIOR BASED ON DATA ON THE SPREAD OF THREE RUMORS THAT CIRCULATED EXTENSIVELY ON SOCIAL MEDIA. USING AN ORDINARY ACCOUNT AS A REFERENCE, WE FOUND THAT THE MEDIATING OR SUPPRESSION EFFECT (I.E., WHEN DIRECT AND INDIRECT EFFECTS ARE SIGNIFICANT AND OPPOSITE) OF FOLLOWER COUNT IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DEBUNKERÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S IDENTITY (CELEBRITY, MEDIA, OR GOVERNMENT) AND SHARING BEHAVIOR WAS SIGNIFICANT. THE THREE TEST IDENTITIES (CELEBRITY, MEDIA, AND GOVERNMENT) HAD MORE FOLLOWERS THAN THE ORDINARY ACCOUNT, WHICH RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE EFFECT ON THE NUMBER OF REPOSTS. THE DEBUNKERÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S IDENTITY DID NOT HAVE A POSITIVE EFFECT ON THE SHARING OF DEBUNKING INFORMATION WHEN CONTROLLING FOR MEDIATING VARIABLES. DEBUNKING INFORMATION WITH EMOTIONAL OVERTONES (POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE) WAS SHARED MORE WIDELY COMPARED WITH INFORMATION WITH NEUTRAL EMOTIONS, AND THE DOMINANT EMOTIONAL POLARITY WAS DIFFERENT IN THE THREE DIFFERENT RUMORS. THESE FINDINGS CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE GENERATION OF DEBUNKING INFORMATION CONTENT, WHICH CAN AID IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES AND IMPROVEMENT IN THE EFFICIENCY OF CRISIS MANAGEMENT.

182,THE PLEBEIAN ALGORITHM A DEMOCRATIC APPROACH TO CENSORSHIP AND MODERATION,"BACKGROUND: THE INFODEMIC CREATED BY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS CREATED SEVERAL SOCIETAL ISSUES, INCLUDING A RISE IN DISTRUST BETWEEN THE PUBLIC AND HEALTH EXPERTS, AND EVEN A REFUSAL OF SOME TO ACCEPT VACCINATION; SOME SOURCES SUGGEST THAT 1 IN 4 AMERICANS WILL REFUSE THE VACCINE. THIS SOCIAL CONCERN CAN BE TRACED TO THE LEVEL OF DIGITIZATION TODAY, PARTICULARLY IN THE FORM OF SOCIAL MEDIA. OBJECTIVE: THE GOAL OF THE RESEARCH IS TO DETERMINE AN OPTIMAL SOCIAL MEDIA ALGORITHM, ONE WHICH IS ABLE TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF CASES OF MISINFORMATION AND WHICH ALSO ENSURES THAT CERTAIN INDIVIDUAL FREEDOMS (EG, THE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION) ARE MAINTAINED. AFTER PERFORMING THE ANALYSIS DESCRIBED HEREIN, AN ALGORITHM WAS ABSTRACTED. THE DISCOVERY OF A SET OF ABSTRACT ASPECTS OF AN OPTIMAL SOCIAL MEDIA ALGORITHM WAS THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY. METHODS: AS SOCIAL MEDIA WAS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO THE SPREAD OF MISINFORMATION, THE TEAM DECIDED TO EXAMINE INFODEMIOLOGY ACROSS VARIOUS TEXT-BASED PLATFORMS (TWITTER, 4CHAN, REDDIT, PARLER, FACEBOOK, AND YOUTUBE). THIS WAS DONE BY USING SENTIMENT ANALYSIS TO COMPARE GENERAL POSTS WITH KEY TERMS FLAGGED AS MISINFORMATION (ALL OF WHICH CONCERN COVID-19) TO DETERMINE THEIR VERITY. IN GATHERING THE DATA SETS, BOTH APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACES (INSTALLED USING PYTHONÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S PIP) AND PRE-EXISTING DATA COMPILED BY STANDARD SCIENTIFIC THIRD PARTIES WERE USED. RESULTS: THE SENTIMENT CAN BE DESCRIBED USING BIMODAL DISTRIBUTIONS FOR EACH PLATFORM, WITH A POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE PEAK, AS WELL AS A SKEWNESS. IT WAS FOUND THAT IN SOME CASES, MISINFORMING POSTS CAN HAVE UP TO 92.5% MORE NEGATIVE SENTIMENT SKEW COMPARED TO ACCURATE POSTS. CONCLUSIONS: FROM THIS, THE NOVEL PLEBEIAN ALGORITHM IS PROPOSED, WHICH USES SENTIMENT ANALYSIS AND POST POPULARITY AS METRICS TO FLAG A POST AS MISINFORMATION. THIS ALGORITHM DIVERGES FROM THAT OF THE STATUS QUO, AS THE PLEBEIAN ALGORITHM USES A DEMOCRATIC PROCESS TO DETECT AND REMOVE MISINFORMATION. A METHOD WAS CONSTRUCTED IN WHICH CONTENT DEEMED AS MISINFORMATION TO BE REMOVED FROM THE PLATFORM IS DETERMINED BY A RANDOMLY SELECTED JURY OF ANONYMOUS USERS. THIS NOT ONLY PREVENTS THESE TYPES OF INFODEMICS BUT ALSO GUARANTEES A MORE DEMOCRATIC WAY OF USING SOCIAL MEDIA THAT IS BENEFICIAL FOR REPAIRING SOCIAL TRUST AND ENCOURAGING THE PUBLICÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S EVIDENCE-INFORMED DECISION-MAKING.

183,FACTORS INFLUENCING WILLINGNESS TO SHARE HEALTH MISINFORMATION VIDEOS ON THE INTERNETWEBBASED SURVEY,"BACKGROUND: THE RAPIDLY EVOLVING DIGITAL ENVIRONMENT OF THE SOCIAL MEDIA ERA HAS INCREASED THE REACH OF BOTH QUALITY HEALTH INFORMATION AND MISINFORMATION. PLATFORMS SUCH AS YOUTUBE ENABLE EASY SHARING OF ATTRACTIVE, IF NOT ALWAYS EVIDENCE-BASED, VIDEOS WITH LARGE PERSONAL NETWORKS AND THE PUBLIC. ALTHOUGH MUCH RESEARCH HAS FOCUSED ON CHARACTERIZING HEALTH MISINFORMATION ON THE INTERNET, IT HAS NOT SUFFICIENTLY FOCUSED ON DESCRIBING AND MEASURING INDIVIDUALS' INFORMATION COMPETENCIES THAT BUILD RESILIENCE. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY AIMS TO ASSESS INDIVIDUALS' WILLINGNESS TO SHARE A NON-EVIDENCE-BASED YOUTUBE VIDEO ABOUT STRENGTHENING THE IMMUNE SYSTEM; TO DESCRIBE TYPES OF EVIDENCE THAT INDIVIDUALS VIEW AS SUPPORTIVE OF THE CLAIM BY THE VIDEO; AND TO RELATE INFORMATION-SHARING BEHAVIOR TO SEVERAL INFORMATION COMPETENCIES, NAMELY, INFORMATION LITERACY, SCIENCE LITERACY, KNOWLEDGE OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM, INTERPERSONAL TRUST, AND TRUST IN HEALTH AUTHORITY. METHODS: A WEB-BASED SURVEY METHODOLOGY WITH 150 INDIVIDUALS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES WAS USED. PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED TO WATCH A YOUTUBE EXCERPT FROM A MORNING TV SHOW FEATURING A WELLNESS PHARMACY REPRESENTATIVE PROMOTING AN IMMUNITY-BOOSTING DIETARY SUPPLEMENT PRODUCED BY HIS COMPANY; ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE VIDEO AND REPORT WHETHER THEY WOULD SHARE IT WITH A COUSIN WHO WAS FREQUENTLY SICK; AND COMPLETE INSTRUMENTS PERTAINING TO THE INFORMATION COMPETENCIES OUTLINED IN THE OBJECTIVES. RESULTS: MOST PARTICIPANTS (105/150, 70%) SAID THAT THEY WOULD SHARE THE VIDEO WITH THEIR COUSINS. THEIR CONFIDENCE IN THE SUPPLEMENT WOULD BE FURTHER BOOSTED BY A FRIEND'S RECOMMENDATIONS, POSITIVE REVIEWS ON A CROWDSOURCING WEBSITE, AND STATEMENTS OF UNCITED EFFECTIVENESS STUDIES ON THE PRODUCER'S WEBSITE. ALTHOUGH ALL INFORMATION LITERACY COMPETENCIES ANALYZED IN THIS STUDY HAD A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP WITH THE OUTCOME, EACH COMPETENCY WAS ALSO HIGHLY CORRELATED WITH THE OTHERS. INFORMATION LITERACY AND INTERPERSONAL TRUST INDEPENDENTLY PREDICTED THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF VARIANCE IN THE INTENTION TO SHARE THE VIDEO (17% AND 16%, RESPECTIVELY). INTERPERSONAL TRUST WAS NEGATIVELY RELATED TO THE WILLINGNESS TO SHARE THE VIDEO. SCIENCE LITERACY EXPLAINED 7% OF THE VARIANCE. CONCLUSIONS: PEOPLE ARE VULNERABLE TO WEB-BASED MISINFORMATION AND ARE LIKELY TO PROPAGATE IT ON THE INTERNET. INFORMATION LITERACY AND SCIENCE LITERACY ARE ASSOCIATED WITH LESS VULNERABILITY TO MISINFORMATION AND A LOWER PROPENSITY TO SPREAD IT.

184,COVID19RELATED RUMOR CONTENT TRANSMISSION AND CLARIFICATION STRATEGIES IN CHINA DESCRIPTIVE STUDY,"BACKGROUND: GIVEN THE PERMEATION OF SOCIAL MEDIA THROUGHOUT SOCIETY, RUMORS SPREAD FASTER THAN EVER BEFORE, WHICH SIGNIFICANTLY COMPLICATES GOVERNMENT RESPONSES TO PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES SUCH AS THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. OBJECTIVE: WE AIMED TO EXAMINE THE CHARACTERISTICS AND PROPAGATION OF RUMORS DURING THE EARLY MONTHS OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IN CHINA AND EVALUATED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF HEALTH AUTHORITIES' RELEASE OF CORRECTION ANNOUNCEMENTS. METHODS: WE RETRIEVED RUMORS WIDELY CIRCULATING ON SOCIAL MEDIA IN CHINA DURING THE EARLY STAGES OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND ASSESSED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT CLARIFICATIONS AND POPULAR SCIENCE ARTICLES REFUTING THOSE RUMORS. RESULTS: WE SHOW THAT THE NUMBER OF RUMORS RELATED TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC FLUCTUATED WIDELY IN CHINA BETWEEN DECEMBER 1, 2019 AND APRIL 15, 2020. RUMORS MAINLY OCCURRED IN 3 PROVINCES: HUBEI, ZHEJIANG, AND GUANGXI. PERSONAL SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS CONSTITUTED THE MAJOR SOURCE OF MEDIA REPORTS OF THE 4 MOST WIDELY DISTRIBUTED RUMORS (THE NOVEL CORONAVIRUS CAN BE PREVENTED WITH ""SHUANGHUANGLIAN"": 7648/10,664, 71.7%; THE NOVEL CORONAVIRUS IS THE SARS CORONAVIRUS: 14,696/15,902, 92.4%; MEDICAL SUPPLIES INTENDED FOR ASSISTING HUBEI WERE DETAINED BY THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT: 3911/3943, 99.2%; ASYMPTOMATICALLY INFECTED PERSONS WERE REGARDED AS DIAGNOSED COVID-19 PATIENTS WITH SYMPTOMS IN OFFICIAL COUNTS: 322/323, 99.7%). THE NUMBER OF RUMORS CIRCULATING WAS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE SEVERITY OF THE COVID-19 EPIDEMIC (P=0.88, 95% CI 0.81-0.93). THE RELEASE OF CORRECTION ARTICLES WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A SUBSTANTIAL DECREASE IN THE PROPORTION OF RUMOR REPORTS COMPARED TO ACCURATE REPORTS. THE PROPORTIONS OF NEGATIVE SENTIMENTS APPEARING AMONG COMMENTS BY CITIZENS IN RESPONSE TO MEDIA ARTICLES DISSEMINATING RUMORS AND DISSEMINATING CORRECT INFORMATION DIFFER INSIGNIFICANTLY (BOTH CORRECT REPORTS: X1 2=0.315, P=.58; BOTH RUMORS: X1 2=0.025, P=.88; FIRST RUMOR AND LAST CORRECT REPORT: X1 2=1.287, P=.26; FIRST CORRECT REPORT AND LAST RUMOR: X1 2=0.033, P=.86). CONCLUSIONS: OUR RESULTS HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE AND URGENCY OF MONITORING AND CORRECTING FALSE OR MISLEADING REPORTS ON WEBSITES AND PERSONAL SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS. THE CIRCULATION OF RUMORS CAN INFLUENCE PUBLIC HEALTH, AND GOVERNMENT BODIES SHOULD ESTABLISH GUIDELINES TO MONITOR AND MITIGATE THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF SUCH RUMORS.

185,TRACKING PRIVATE WHATSAPP DISCOURSE ABOUT COVID19 IN SINGAPORE LONGITUDINAL INFODEMIOLOGY STUDY,"BACKGROUND: WORLDWIDE, SOCIAL MEDIA TRAFFIC INCREASED FOLLOWING THE ONSET OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. ALTHOUGH THE SPREAD OF COVID-19 CONTENT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED FOR SEVERAL SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS (EG, TWITTER AND FACEBOOK), LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW SUCH CONTENT IS SPREAD VIA PRIVATE MESSAGING PLATFORMS, SUCH AS WHATSAPP (WHATSAPP LLC). OBJECTIVE: IN THIS STUDY, WE DOCUMENTED (1) HOW WHATSAPP IS USED TO TRANSMIT COVID-19 CONTENT, (2) THE CHARACTERISTICS OF WHATSAPP USERS BASED ON THEIR USAGE PATTERNS, AND (3) HOW USAGE PATTERNS LINK TO COVID-19 CONCERNS. METHODS: WE USED THE EXPERIENCE SAMPLING METHOD TO TRACK DAY-TO-DAY WHATSAPP USAGE DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. FOR 1 WEEK, PARTICIPANTS REPORTED EACH DAY THE EXTENT TO WHICH THEY HAD RECEIVED, FORWARDED, OR DISCUSSED COVID-19 CONTENT. THE FINAL DATA SET COMPRISED 924 DATA POINTS, WHICH WERE COLLECTED FROM 151 PARTICIPANTS. RESULTS: DURING THE WEEKLONG MONITORING PROCESS, MOST PARTICIPANTS (143/151, 94.7%) REPORTED AT LEAST 1 COVID-19-RELATED USE OF WHATSAPP. WHEN A TAXONOMY WAS GENERATED BASED ON USAGE PATTERNS, AROUND 1 IN 10 PARTICIPANTS (21/151, 13.9%) WERE FOUND TO HAVE RECEIVED AND SHARED A HIGH VOLUME OF FORWARDED COVID-19 CONTENT, AKIN TO SUPER-SPREADERS IDENTIFIED ON OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS. FINALLY, THOSE WHO ENGAGED WITH MORE COVID-19 CONTENT IN THEIR PERSONAL CHATS WERE MORE LIKELY TO REPORT HAVING COVID-19-RELATED THOUGHTS THROUGHOUT THE DAY. CONCLUSIONS: OUR FINDINGS PROVIDE A RARE WINDOW INTO DISCOURSE ON PRIVATE MESSAGING PLATFORMS. SUCH DATA CAN BE USED TO INFORM RISK COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES DURING THE PANDEMIC.

186,SMOKERS LIKELIHOOD TO ENGAGE WITH INFORMATION AND MISINFORMATION ON TWITTER ABOUT THE RELATIVE HARMS OF ECIGARETTE USE RESULTS FROM A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL,"BACKGROUND: INFORMATION AND MISINFORMATION ON THE INTERNET ABOUT E-CIGARETTE HARMS MAY INCREASE SMOKERS' MISPERCEPTIONS OF E-CIGARETTES. THERE IS LIMITED RESEARCH ON SMOKERS' ENGAGEMENT WITH INFORMATION AND MISINFORMATION ABOUT E-CIGARETTES ON SOCIAL MEDIA. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY ASSESSED SMOKERS' LIKELIHOOD TO ENGAGE WITH-DEFINED AS REPLYING, RETWEETING, LIKING, AND SHARING-TWEETS THAT CONTAIN INFORMATION AND MISINFORMATION AND UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE HARMS OF E-CIGARETTES. METHODS: WE CONDUCTED A WEB-BASED RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL AMONG 2400 UK AND US ADULT SMOKERS WHO DID NOT VAPE IN THE PAST 30 DAYS. PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO VIEW FOUR TWEETS IN ONE OF FOUR CONDITIONS: (1) E-CIGARETTES ARE AS HARMFUL OR MORE HARMFUL THAN SMOKING, (2) E-CIGARETTES ARE COMPLETELY HARMLESS, (3) UNCERTAINTY ABOUT E-CIGARETTE HARMS, OR (4) CONTROL (PHYSICAL ACTIVITY). THE OUTCOME MEASURE WAS PARTICIPANTS' LIKELIHOOD OF ENGAGING WITH TWEETS, WHICH COMPRISED THE SUM OF WHETHER THEY WOULD REPLY, RETWEET, LIKE, AND SHARE EACH TWEET. WE FITTED POISSON REGRESSION MODELS TO PREDICT THE LIKELIHOOD OF ENGAGEMENT WITH TWEETS AMONG 974 TWITTER USERS AND 1287 NON-TWITTER SOCIAL MEDIA USERS, ADJUSTING FOR COVARIATES AND STRATIFIED BY UK AND US PARTICIPANTS. RESULTS: AMONG TWITTER USERS, PARTICIPANTS WERE MORE LIKELY TO ENGAGE WITH TWEETS IN CONDITION 1 (E-CIGARETTES ARE AS HARMFUL OR MORE HARMFUL THAN SMOKING) THAN IN CONDITION 2 (E-CIGARETTES ARE COMPLETELY HARMLESS). AMONG OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA USERS, PARTICIPANTS WERE MORE LIKELY TO LIKELY TO ENGAGE WITH TWEETS IN CONDITION 1 THAN IN CONDITIONS 2 AND 3 (E-CIGARETTES ARE COMPLETELY HARMLESS AND UNCERTAINTY ABOUT E-CIGARETTE HARMS). CONCLUSIONS: TWEETS STATING INFORMATION AND MISINFORMATION THAT E-CIGARETTES WERE AS HARMFUL OR MORE HARMFUL THAN SMOKING REGULAR CIGARETTES MAY RECEIVE HIGHER ENGAGEMENT THAN TWEETS INDICATING E-CIGARETTES WERE COMPLETELY HARMLESS.

187,PUBLIC SPHERE ATTITUDES TOWARDS THE RUMOR SOURCES OF THE COVID19 PANDEMIC EVIDENCE FROM COMMUNITY PERCEPTIONS IN IRAN,"BACKGROUND: IN THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, RUMORS TRAVEL FAR FASTER THAN THE OUTBREAK ITSELF. THE CURRENT STUDY AIMED TO EVALUATE THE FACTORS AFFECTING THE ATTITUDES OF INDIVIDUALS TOWARDS THE RUMORS-PRODUCING MEDIA IN IRAN. METHODS: AN ONLINE CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED IN IRAN IN MARCH 2020 ON THE SOURCE OF INFORMATION AND RUMORS, ALONG WITH THE PERCEPTION OF INDIVIDUALS REGARDING THE REASONS FOR RUMORS PROPAGATION DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. RESULTS: RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE PARTICIPANTS (59.3%) BELIEVED THAT SOCIAL MEDIA WERE THE MAIN SOURCE OF RUMORS. THE LACK OF A RELIABLE AND FORMAL NEWS RESOURCE WAS ALSO CONSIDERED THE MOST COMMON CAUSE OF RUMORING BY THE PARTICIPANTS (63.6%). AN EVALUATION WAS CARRIED OUT TO IDENTIFY THE MAIN SOURCE OF MISINFORMATION AND RUMORS. RESULTS SHOWED THAT RETIRED PARTICIPANTS CONSIDERED FOREIGN MEDIA (P < 0.001) AS THE MAIN RESOURCE. THE MIDDLE-INCOME LEVEL PARTICIPANTS BELIEVED THAT SOCIAL MEDIA (P < 0.001) WERE THE MAIN SOURCE. IN THIS REGARD, THE HIGHLY EDUCATED PARTICIPANTS (P < 0.001), GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES, AND MIDDLE-INCOME INDIVIDUALS (P = 0.008) BELIEVED THAT NATIONAL MEDIA PRODUCED RUMORS. CONCLUSION: ALTHOUGH FINDINGS WERE ACHIEVED DURING THE FIRST PEAK OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, THE AUTHORITIES IMMEDIATELY INTRODUCED THE NATIONAL MEDIA AS A RELIABLE NEWS RESOURCE, WHICH ALLOWED BOTH MEDIA AND ITS JOURNALISTS TO REDUCE THE GAP BETWEEN THEMSELVES AND THE PUBLIC SPHERE. IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT SOCIAL NETWORKS AND FOREIGN MEDIA BE MORE ACCOUNTABLE IN PANDEMICS.

189,EMOTIONS EXPLAIN DIFFERENCES IN THE DIFFUSION OF TRUE VS FALSE SOCIAL MEDIA RUMORS,"FALSE RUMORS (OFTEN TERMED Ã¢â‚¬Å“FAKE NEWSÃ¢â‚¬Â) ON SOCIAL MEDIA POSE A SIGNIFICANT THREAT TO MODERN SOCIETIES. HOWEVER, POTENTIAL REASONS FOR THE WIDESPREAD DIFFUSION OF FALSE RUMORS HAVE BEEN UNDEREXPLORED. IN THIS WORK, WE ANALYZE WHETHER SENTIMENT WORDS, AS WELL AS DIFFERENT EMOTIONAL WORDS, IN SOCIAL MEDIA CONTENT EXPLAIN DIFFERENCES IN THE SPREAD OF TRUE VS. FALSE RUMORS. FOR THIS PURPOSE, WE COLLECTED N= 126 , 301 RUMOR CASCADES FROM TWITTER, COMPRISING MORE THAN 4.5 MILLION RETWEETS THAT HAVE BEEN FACT-CHECKED FOR VERACITY. WE THEN CATEGORIZED THE LANGUAGE IN SOCIAL MEDIA CONTENT TO (1) SENTIMENT (I.E., POSITIVE VS. NEGATIVE) AND (2) EIGHT BASIC EMOTIONS (I.Ã‚Â E., ANGER, ANTICIPATION, DISGUST, FEAR, JOY, TRUST, SADNESS, AND SURPRISE). WE FIND THAT SENTIMENT AND BASIC EMOTIONS EXPLAIN DIFFERENCES IN THE STRUCTURAL PROPERTIES OF TRUE VS. FALSE RUMOR CASCADES. FALSE RUMORS (AS COMPARED TO TRUE RUMORS) ARE MORE LIKELY TO GO VIRAL IF THEY CONVEY A HIGHER PROPORTION OF TERMS ASSOCIATED WITH A POSITIVE SENTIMENT. FURTHER, FALSE RUMORS ARE VIRAL WHEN EMBEDDING EMOTIONAL WORDS CLASSIFIED AS TRUST, ANTICIPATION, OR ANGER. ALL ELSE BEING EQUAL, FALSE RUMORS CONVEYING ONE STANDARD DEVIATION MORE POSITIVE SENTIMENT HAVE A 37.58% LONGER LIFETIME AND REACH 61.44% MORE USERS. OUR FINDINGS OFFER INSIGHTS INTO HOW TRUE VS. FALSE RUMORS SPREAD AND HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF MANAGING EMOTIONS IN SOCIAL MEDIA CONTENT.

192,YOUTUBE VIDEOS AS AN EDUCATIONAL RESOURCE FOR VENTROGLUTEAL INJECTION A CONTENT RELIABILITY AND QUALITY ANALYSIS,"BACKGROUND: YOUTUBE HAS BECOME AN IMPORTANT SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM FOR TEACHING NURSING SKILLS. HOWEVER, THE CONTENT, RELIABILITY AND QUALITY LEVELS OF THE VIDEOS ON THIS PLATFORM ARE NOT ADEQUATELY KNOWN. OBJECTIVES: THIS STUDY AIMS TO EVALUATE THE CONTENT, RELIABILITY AND QUALITY OF YOUTUBE VIDEOS ON VENTROGLUTEAL INJECTION APPLICATION. DESIGN: DESCRIPTIVE. SETTINGS: ONLINE. PARTICIPANTS: 26 VIDEOS ABOUT VENTROGLUTEAL INJECTION. METHODS: VIDEOS WERE SEARCHED USING THE KEYWORD Ã¢â‚¬Å“VENTROGLUTEAL INJECTIONÃ¢â‚¬Â. THE CONTENT OF THE 26 VIDEOS MEETING THE INCLUSION CRITERIA WERE EVALUATED USING THE Ã¢â‚¬Å“VENTROGLUTEAL INTRAMUSCULAR INJECTION SKILL FORMÃ¢â‚¬Â, THE RELIABILITY WITH THE Ã¢â‚¬Å“DISCERN QUESTIONNAIREÃ¢â‚¬Â, AND THE QUALITY LEVELS USING THE Ã¢â‚¬Å“GLOBAL QUALITY SCALEÃ¢â‚¬Â. THE VIDEOS WERE CATEGORIZED BY THEIR THEME, TYPE AND UPLOAD SOURCE, AND ANALYSED STATISTICALLY. RESULTS: OF THE 26 VIDEOS MEETING THE INCLUSION CRITERIA, 21 (80.8%) WERE CLASSIFIED AS USEFUL INFORMATION, 5 (19.2%) AS MISLEADING INFORMATION BY THEME, 22 (84.6%) AS EDUCATIONAL, 4 (15.4%) AS HORMONE THERAPY BY TYPE, 5 (19.2%) AS OFFICIAL INSTITUTIONS, 13 (50%) AS INDIVIDUAL BY SOURCE OF UPLOADS. THE CONTENT, RELIABILITY, QUALITY SCORE OF USEFUL VIDEOS WERE HIGHER THAN MISLEADING VIDEOS. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE (P < 0.05) BETWEEN RELIABILITY SCORE AND THE SOURCE OF VIDEO UPLOADS. PAIRWISE COMPARISONS INDICATED THAT THERE WAS NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE (P > 0.05) BETWEEN THE SOURCE OF UPLOADS OF VIDEO AND CHARACTERISTICS. CONCLUSIONS: THE USE OF THE EXAMINED YOUTUBE VIDEOS IN THE TRAINING OF INJECTION INTO THE VENTROGLUTEAL SITE APPEARS TO HAVE VARIOUS RISKS IN TERMS OF ETHICS AND PATIENT SAFETY. IT MAY BE SUGGESTED THAT THE INJECTION VIDEOS SHOULD BE PREPARED BY COMPETENT INSTITUTIONS/INDIVIDUALS, USING BEST PRACTICE GUIDES TO INCREASE THE CONTENT, RELIABILITY AND QUALITY LEVELS. IT SHOULD PARTICULARLY BE BORNE IN MIND THAT VIDEOS ON HORMONE THERAPY CAN BE A PUBLIC HEALTH THREAT.

203,EVALUATING RUMOR DEBUNKING EFFECTIVENESS DURING THE COVID19 PANDEMIC CRISIS UTILIZING USER STANCE IN COMMENTS ON SINA WEIBO,"BACKGROUND: THE SPREAD OF RUMORS RELATED TO COVID-19 ON SOCIAL MEDIA HAS POSED SUBSTANTIAL CHALLENGES TO PUBLIC HEALTH GOVERNANCE, AND THUS EXPOSING RUMORS AND CURBING THEIR SPREAD QUICKLY AND EFFECTIVELY HAS BECOME AN URGENT TASK. THIS STUDY AIMED TO ASSIST IN FORMULATING EFFECTIVE STRATEGIES TO DEBUNK RUMORS AND CURB THEIR SPREAD ON SOCIAL MEDIA. METHODS: A TOTAL OF 2,053 ORIGINAL POSTINGS AND 100,348 COMMENTS THAT REPLIED TO THE POSTINGS OF FIVE FALSE RUMORS RELATED TO COVID-19 (DATED FROM JANUARY 20, 2020, TO JUNE 28, 2020) BELONGING TO THREE CATEGORIES, AUTHORITATIVE, SOCIAL, AND POLITICAL, ON SINA WEIBO IN CHINA WERE RANDOMLY SELECTED. TO STUDY THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DIFFERENT DEBUNKING METHODS, A NEW ANNOTATION SCHEME WAS PROPOSED THAT DIVIDES DEBUNKING METHODS INTO SIX CATEGORIES: DENIAL, FURTHER FACT-CHECKING, REFUTATION, PERSON RESPONSE, ORGANIZATION RESPONSE, AND COMBINATION METHODS. TEXT CLASSIFIERS USING DEEP LEARNING METHODS WERE BUILT TO AUTOMATICALLY IDENTIFY FOUR USER STANCES IN COMMENTS THAT REPLIED TO DEBUNKING POSTINGS: SUPPORTING, DENYING, QUERYING, AND COMMENTING STANCES. THEN, BASED ON STANCE RESPONSES, A DEBUNKING EFFECTIVENESS INDEX (DEI) WAS DEVELOPED TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DIFFERENT DEBUNKING METHODS. RESULTS: THE REFUTATION METHOD WITH CITED EVIDENCE HAS THE BEST DEBUNKING EFFECT, WHETHER USED ALONE OR IN COMBINATION WITH OTHER DEBUNKING METHODS. FOR THE SOCIAL CATEGORY OF CAR RUMOR AND POLITICAL CATEGORY OF RUSSIA RUMOR, USING THE REFUTATION METHOD ALONE CAN ACHIEVE THE OPTIMAL DEBUNKING EFFECT. FOR AUTHORITATIVE RUMORS, A COMBINATION METHOD HAS THE OPTIMAL DEBUNKING EFFECT, BUT THE MOST EFFECTIVE COMBINATION METHOD REQUIRES AVOIDING THE USE OF A COMBINATION OF A DEBUNKING METHOD WHERE THE PERSON OR ORGANIZATION DEFAMED BY THE AUTHORITATIVE RUMOR RESPONDS PERSONALLY AND THE REFUTATION METHOD. CONCLUSION: THE FINDINGS PROVIDE RELEVANT INSIGHTS INTO WAYS TO DEBUNK RUMORS EFFECTIVELY, SUPPORT CRISIS MANAGEMENT OF FALSE INFORMATION, AND TAKE NECESSARY ACTIONS IN RESPONSE TO RUMORS AMID PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES.

207,THE EVOLUTION OF RUMORS ON A CLOSED SOCIAL NETWORKING PLATFORM DURING COVID19 ALGORITHM DEVELOPMENT AND CONTENT STUDY,"BACKGROUND: IN 2020, THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC PUT THE WORLD IN A CRISIS REGARDING BOTH PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH. SIMULTANEOUSLY, A MYRIAD OF UNVERIFIED INFORMATION FLOWED ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND ONLINE OUTLETS. THE SITUATION WAS SO SEVERE THAT THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION IDENTIFIED IT AS AN INFODEMIC IN FEBRUARY 2020. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE PROPAGATION PATTERNS AND TEXTUAL TRANSFORMATION OF COVID-19-RELATED RUMORS ON A CLOSED SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM. METHODS: WE OBTAINED A DATA SET OF SUSPICIOUS TEXT MESSAGES COLLECTED ON TAIWAN'S MOST POPULAR INSTANT MESSAGING PLATFORM, LINE, BETWEEN JANUARY AND JULY 2020. WE PROPOSED A CLASSIFICATION-BASED CLUSTERING ALGORITHM THAT COULD EFFICIENTLY CLUSTER MESSAGES INTO GROUPS, WITH EACH GROUP REPRESENTING A RUMOR. FOR EASE OF UNDERSTANDING, A GROUP IS REFERRED TO AS A ""RUMOR GROUP."" MESSAGES IN A RUMOR GROUP COULD BE IDENTICAL OR COULD HAVE LIMITED TEXTUAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THEM. THEREFORE, EACH MESSAGE IN A RUMOR GROUP IS A FORM OF THE RUMOR. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 936 RUMOR GROUPS WITH AT LEAST 10 MESSAGES EACH WERE DISCOVERED AMONG 114,124 TEXT MESSAGES COLLECTED FROM LINE. AMONG 936 RUMORS, 396 (42.3%) WERE RELATED TO COVID-19. OF THE 396 COVID-19-RELATED RUMORS, 134 (33.8%) HAD BEEN FACT-CHECKED BY THE INTERNATIONAL FACT-CHECKING NETWORK-CERTIFIED AGENCIES IN TAIWAN AND DETERMINED TO BE FALSE OR MISLEADING. BY STUDYING THE PREVALENCE OF SIMPLIFIED CHINESE CHARACTERS OR PHRASES IN THE MESSAGES THAT ORIGINATED IN CHINA, WE FOUND THAT COVID-19-RELATED MESSAGES, COMPARED TO NON-COVID-19-RELATED MESSAGES, WERE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE BEEN WRITTEN BY NON-TAIWANESE USERS. THE ASSOCIATION WAS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT, WITH P<.001, AS DETERMINED BY THE CHI-SQUARE INDEPENDENCE TEST. THE QUALITATIVE INVESTIGATIONS OF THE THREE MOST POPULAR COVID-19 RUMORS REVEALED THAT KEY AUTHORITATIVE FIGURES, MOSTLY MEDICAL PERSONNEL, WERE OFTEN MISQUOTED IN THE MESSAGES. IN ADDITION, THESE RUMORS RESURFACED MULTIPLE TIMES AFTER BEING FACT-CHECKED, USUALLY PRECEDED BY MAJOR SOCIETAL EVENTS OR TEXTUAL TRANSFORMATIONS. CONCLUSIONS: TO FIGHT THE INFODEMIC, IT IS CRUCIAL THAT WE FIRST UNDERSTAND WHY AND HOW A RUMOR BECOMES POPULAR. WHILE SOCIAL MEDIA HAS GIVEN RISE TO AN UNPRECEDENTED NUMBER OF UNVERIFIED RUMORS, IT ALSO PROVIDES A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO STUDY THE PROPAGATION OF RUMORS AND THEIR INTERACTIONS WITH SOCIETY. THEREFORE, WE MUST PUT MORE EFFORT INTO THESE AREAS. Ã‚Â© 2021 JMIR PUBLICATIONS INC..

208,OBJECTIVE KNOWLEDGE MEDIATES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA AND COVID19RELATED FALSE MEMORIES,"THE EXPOSURE TO RELEVANT SOCIAL AND/OR HISTORICAL EVENTS CAN INCREASE THE GENERATION OF FALSE MEMORIES (FMS). THE CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 (COVID-19) PANDEMIC IS A CALAMITY CHALLENGING HEALTH, POLITICAL, AND JOURNALISTIC BODIES, WITH MEDIA GENERATING CONFUSION THAT HAS FACILITATED THE SPREAD OF FAKE NEWS. IN THIS RESPECT, OUR STUDY AIMS AT INVESTIGATING THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MEMORIES (TRUE MEMORIES, TMS VS. FMS) FOR COVID-19-RELATED NEWS AND DIFFERENT INDIVIDUAL VARIABLES (I.E., USE OF TRADITIONAL AND SOCIAL MEDIA, COVID-19 PERCEIVED AND OBJECTIVE KNOWLEDGE, FEAR OF THE DISEASE, DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY SYMPTOMS, REASONING SKILLS, AND COPING MECHANISMS). ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY-ONE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS (131 FEMALES) WERE SURVEYED. OVERALL, OUR RESULTS SUGGESTED THAT DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY SYMPTOMS, REASONING SKILLS, AND COPING MECHANISMS DID NOT AFFECT THE FORMATION OF FMS. CONVERSELY, THE FEAR OF LOVED ONES CONTRACTING THE INFECTION WAS FOUND TO BE NEGATIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH FMS. THIS FINDING MIGHT BE DUE TO AN EMPATHY/PROSOCIALITY-BASED POSITIVE BIAS BOOSTING MEMORY ABILITIES, ALSO EXPLAINED BY THE YOUNG AGE OF PARTICIPANTS. FURTHERMORE, OBJECTIVE KNOWLEDGE (I) PREDICTED AN INCREASE IN TMS AND DECREASE IN FMS AND (II) SIGNIFICANTLY MEDIATED THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA AND DEVELOPMENT OF BOTH TMS AND FMS. IN PARTICULAR, HIGHER LEVELS OF OBJECTIVE KNOWLEDGE STRENGTHENED THE FORMATION OF TMS AND DECREASED THE DEVELOPMENT OF FMS FOLLOWING USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA. THESE RESULTS MAY LEAD TO RECONSIDERING THE IDEA OF SOCIAL MEDIA AS THE MAIN SOURCE OF FAKE NEWS. THIS CLAIM IS FURTHER SUPPORTED BY EITHER THE LACK OF SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE USE OF TRADITIONAL AND SOCIAL MEDIA AMONG PARTICIPANTS REPORTING FMS OR THE POSITIVE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA AND LEVELS OF OBJECTIVE KNOWLEDGE. THE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE TOPIC RATHER THAN THE TYPE OF SOURCE WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE PROCESS OF MEMORY FORMATION. Ã‚Â© 2021 BY THE AUTHORS.

209,IS SOCIAL MEDIA SPREADING MISINFORMATION ON EXERCISE AND HEALTH IN BRAZIL,"INSTAGRAM (IG) REACHES MILLIONS OF PEOPLE, SHARING PERSONAL CONTENT AND ALL KINDS OF INFORMATION, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO EXERCISE AND HEALTH. HOWEVER, THE SCIENTIFIC QUALITY OF THE POSTED INFORMATION IS QUESTIONABLE. THUS, THIS STUDY AIMED TO ANALYZE WHETHER EXERCISE AND HEALTH INFORMATION POSTED BY POPULAR BRAZILIAN IG INFLUENCERS HAS TECHNICAL-SCIENTIFIC ACCURACY. A PERSONAL IG ACCOUNT WAS CREATED TO IDENTIFY BRAZILIAN IG PROFILES. THE INCLUSION CRITERIA OF THE ACCOUNTS WERE: (1) HAVING 50% OF ALL THE SHARED POSTS RELATED TO TOPICS ABOUT EXERCISE AND HEALTH, SUCH AS NUTRITION, HEALTH AND WELLNESS, MEDICINE, OR PHYSICAL FITNESS; AND (2) HAVING OVER 100,000 FOLLOWERS. QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS REVEALED A LOW QUALITY PERCENTAGE (38.79 Ã‚Â± 25.43%) FOR ALL ANALYZED POSTS. OUT OF ALL THE POSTS, ONLY 13 (~2.7%) CITED A REFERENCE ENDORSING THE INFORMATION. MOREOVER, THE HIGHER QUALITYRATIO SCORE OF THE POSTS WAS NOT DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE HIGHER EDUCATIONAL QUALIFICATION OF THE INFLUENCERS (R = 0.313; P = 0.076). NEVERTHELESS, THE NUMBER OF FOLLOWERS WAS INVERSELY CORRELATED WITH THE EDUCATIONAL QUALIFICATION OF THE INFLUENCERS (R = -0.450; P = 0.009), BUT NOT WITH THE QUALITY-RATIO SCORE OF THE POSTS (R = -0.178 P = 0.322). WE CONCLUDE THAT PROMINENT BRAZILIAN IG INFLUENCERS DISSEMINATE LOW-QUALITY INFORMATION ABOUT EXERCISE AND HEALTH, CONTRIBUTING TO THE WIDE-SPREADING OF MISINFORMATION TO MILLIONS OF FOLLOWERS.

THIS RESEARCH INVESTIGATED HOW THE COMMUNICATION OF UNCERTAINTY ABOUT PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE AFFECTS THE SPREAD OF ITS INFERRED MISINFORMATION IN A WEIBO CASE STUDY. IN TOTAL, 3439 WEIBO POSTS AND 10,380 REPOSTS REGARDING THE MISINFORMATION OF PETS TRANSMITTING COVID-19 WERE ANALYZED. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT ATTITUDE AMBIGUITY TOWARD THE PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE AND THE STAGE WHEN THE EVIDENCE WAS FIRST RELEASED WITH UNCERTAINTY WERE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER NUMBERS OF LIKES AND RETWEETS OF MISINFORMATION POSTS.

217,FOOLED BY THE FAKES COGNITIVE DIFFERENCES IN PERCEIVED CLAIM ACCURACY AND SHARING INTENTION OF NONPOLITICAL DEEPFAKES,"WE EXAMINE HOW INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES INFLUENCE PERCEIVED ACCURACY OF DEEPFAKE CLAIMS AND SHARING INTENTION. RATHER THAN POLITICAL DEEPFAKES, WE USE A NON-POLITICAL DEEPFAKE OF A SOCIAL MEDIA INFLUENCER AS THE STIMULUS, WITH AN EDUCATIONAL AND A DECEPTIVE CONDITION. WE FIND THAT INDIVIDUALS ARE MORE LIKELY TO PERCEIVE THE DEEPFAKE CLAIM TO BE TRUE WHEN INFORMATIVE CUES ARE MISSING ALONG WITH THE DEEPFAKE (COMPARED TO WHEN THEY ARE PRESENT). ALSO, INDIVIDUALS ARE MORE LIKELY TO SHARE DEEPFAKES WHEN THEY CONSIDER THE FABRICATED CLAIM TO BE ACCURATE. MOREOVER, WE FIND THAT COGNITIVE ABILITY PLAYS A MODERATING ROLE SUCH THAT WHEN INFORMATIVE CUES ARE PRESENT (EDUCATIONAL CONDITION), INDIVIDUALS WITH HIGH COGNITIVE ABILITY ARE LESS TRUSTFUL OF DEEPFAKE CLAIMS. UNEXPECTEDLY, WHEN THE INFORMATIVE CUES ARE MISSING (DECEPTIVE CONDITION), THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE MORE LIKELY TO CONSIDER THE CLAIM TO BE TRUE AND SHARE THEM. THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT ADDING CORRECTIVE LABELS CAN HELP REDUCE INADVERTENT SHARING OF DISINFORMATION. ALSO, USER BIASES SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN UNDERSTANDING PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT WITH DISINFORMATION.

219,CREDIBILITY OF SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA VARIATION BY PLATFORM GENRE AND PRESENCE OF FORMAL CREDIBILITY CUES,"RESPONDING TO CALLS TO TAKE A MORE ACTIVE ROLE IN COMMUNICATING THEIR RESEARCH FINDINGS, SCIENTISTS ARE INCREASINGLY USING OPEN ONLINE PLATFORMS, SUCH AS TWITTER, TO ENGAGE IN SCIENCE COMMUNICATION OR TO PUBLICIZE THEIR WORK. GIVEN THE EASE WITH WHICH MISINFORMATION SPREADS ON THESE PLATFORMS, IT IS IMPORTANT FOR SCIENTISTS TO PRESENT THEIR FINDINGS IN A MANNER THAT APPEARS CREDIBLE. TO EXAMINE THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE ONLINE PRESENTATION OF SCIENCE INFORMATION RELATES TO ITS PERCEIVED CREDIBILITY, WE DESIGNED AND CONDUCTED TWO SURVEYS ON AMAZONÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S MECHANICAL TURK. IN THE FIRST SURVEY, PARTICIPANTS RATED THE CREDIBILITY OF SCIENCE INFORMATION ON TWITTER COMPARED WITH THE SAME INFORMATION IN OTHER MEDIA, AND IN THE SECOND, PARTICIPANTS RATED THE CREDIBILITY OF TWEETS WITH MODIFIED CHARACTERISTICS: PRESENCE OF AN IMAGE, TEXT SENTIMENT, AND THE NUMBER OF LIKES/RETWEETS. WE FIND THAT SIMILAR INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENTIFIC FINDINGS IS PERCEIVED AS LESS CREDIBLE WHEN PRESENTED ON TWITTER COMPARED TO OTHER PLATFORMS, AND THAT PERCEIVED CREDIBILITY INCREASES WHEN PRESENTED WITH RECOGNIZABLE FEATURES OF A SCIENTIFIC ARTICLE. ON A PLATFORM AS WIDELY DISTRUSTED AS TWITTER, USE OF THESE FEATURES MAY ALLOW RESEARCHERS WHO REGULARLY USE TWITTER FOR RESEARCH-RELATED NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATION TO PRESENT THEIR FINDINGS IN THE MOST CREDIBLE FORMATS.

220,WHY PEOPLE SPREAD RUMORS ON SOCIAL MEDIA DEVELOPING AND VALIDATING A MULTIATTRIBUTE MODEL OF ONLINE RUMOR DISSEMINATION,"PURPOSE: DEALING WITH ONLINE RUMORS OR FAKE INFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA IS GROWING IN IMPORTANCE. MOST ACADEMIC RESEARCH ON ONLINE RUMORS HAS APPROACHED THE ISSUE FROM A QUANTITATIVE MODELING PERSPECTIVE. LESS ATTENTION HAS BEEN PAID TO THE PSYCHOLOGICAL MECHANISMS ACCOUNTING FOR ONLINE RUMOR TRANSMISSION BEHAVIOR ON THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL. DRAWING FROM THE THEORY OF STIMULUSÃ¢â‚¬â€œORGANISMÃ¢â‚¬â€œRESPONSE, THIS STUDY AIMS TO EXPLORE THE NATURE OF ONLINE RUMORS AND INVESTIGATE HOW THE INFORMATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF ONLINE RUMORS ARE PROCESSED THROUGH THE MEDIATION OF PSYCHOLOGICAL VARIABLES TO PROMOTE ONLINE RUMOR FORWARDING. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: AN EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH TO THIS ISSUE WAS TAKEN; THE RESEARCHERS INVESTIGATED HOW THE INFORMATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF ONLINE RUMORS AND THE PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDIATORS PROMOTE ONLINE RUMOR TRANSMISSION. FINDINGS: FOUR INFORMATION CHARACTERISTICS (SENSE-MAKING, FUNNINESS, DREADFULNESS AND PERSONAL RELEVANCE) AND THREE PSYCHOLOGICAL MOTIVATORS (FACT-FINDING, RELATIONSHIP ENHANCEMENT AND SELF-ENHANCEMENT) PROMOTE ONLINE RUMOR-FORWARDING BEHAVIOR. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: BECAUSE ANY ONLINE RUMOR TRANSMITTED ON SOCIAL MEDIA CAN GO VIRAL, COMPANIES MAY EVENTUALLY ENCOUNTER SOCIAL MEDIA-DRIVEN CRISES. THUS, UNDERSTANDING WHAT DRIVES RUMOR-FORWARDING BEHAVIOR CAN HELP MARKETERS MITIGATE AND COUNTER ONLINE RUMORS.

222,A CONTENT ANALYSIS OF SOCIAL MEDIA ON OUTBREAK OF INFODEMIC AMIDST COVID19 PANDEMIC,"BACKGROUND: WITH SO MUCH CONTENT ON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS ABOUT COVID-19, DETERMINING WHICH INFORMATION IS RELIABLE CAN BE A DAUNTING TASK. HENCE, THIS STUDY IS AIMED TO ANALYZE VARIOUS POSTS WITH REGARD TO COVID-19 ON VARIOUS SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS FOR THEIR RELIABILITY AND ALSO EXAMINED VARIOUS FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE INFORMATION RELIABILITY. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY WAS CONDUCTED, WITH 934 SAMPLES RELATED TO CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC PUBLISHED ON TWITTER, INSTAGRAM, AND FACEBOOK USING SYSTEMATIC RANDOM SAMPLING. WE ADOPTED THE CRITERIA GIVEN BY PAUL BRADSHAW AND MODIFIED TO ASSESS THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SAMPLES. TRAINING AND CALIBRATION OF THE INVESTIGATORS WERE CARRIED OUT FOR 3 CONSECUTIVE DAYS BEFORE BEGINNING THE STUDY. THE DATA WERE ANALYZED USING THE CHI-SQUARE TEST AND MULTINOMIAL LOGISTIC REGRESSION TO ESTIMATE THE ODDS RATIOS. RESULTS: OUT OF 934 SAMPLES STUDIED, ONLY 570 (61%) WERE FOUND TO BE RELIABLE OF WHICH 243 (42.6%) WERE FROM TWITTER, 117 (20.6%) FROM INSTAGRAM, AND 210 (36.8%) FROM FACEBOOK. WE FOUND THAT THE RELIABILITY OF THE INFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS IS SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCED BY NETWORK (ODDS: 1.32; 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI]: 1.16-1.52; P = 0.036), CONTENT (ODDS: 1.83; 95% CI: 1.69-1.92; P = 0.009), CONTEXTUAL UPDATE (ODDS: 1.41; 95% CI: 1.24-1.53) AND AGE OF THE ACCOUNT (ODDS: 1.92; 95% CI: 1.64-2.09; P = 0.002). CONCLUSION: OUR STUDY SHOWS THAT THE RELIABILITY OF THE SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDS ON THE NETWORK, CONTEXTUAL UPDATE, AND AGE OF THE ACCOUNT. HENCE, CROSS VERIFYING THE INFORMATION FROM A RELIABLE SOURCE IS THE NEED OF THE HOUR TO PREVENT PANIC AND MENTAL DISTRESS.

224,PEERTOPEER SOCIAL MEDIA COMMUNICATION ABOUT DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS USED FOR WEIGHT LOSS AND SPORTS PERFORMANCE AMONG MILITARY PERSONNEL PILOT CONTENT ANALYSIS OF 11 YEARS OF POSTS ON REDDIT,"BACKGROUND: OVER 60% OF MILITARY PERSONNEL IN THE UNITED STATES CURRENTLY USE DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS. TWO TYPES OF DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS, WEIGHT LOSS AND SPORTS PERFORMANCE (WLSP) SUPPLEMENTS, ARE COMMONLY USED BY MILITARY PERSONNEL DESPITE THE ASSOCIATED SERIOUS ADVERSE EFFECTS SUCH AS DEHYDRATION AND STROKE. OBJECTIVE: TO UNDERSTAND PEER-TO-PEER COMMUNICATION ABOUT WLSP SUPPLEMENTS AMONG MILITARY PERSONNEL, WE CONDUCTED A PILOT STUDY USING THE SOCIAL MEDIA WEBSITE, REDDIT. METHODS: A TOTAL OF 64 RELEVANT POSTS AND 243 COMMENTS FROM 2009 TO 2019 WERE COLLECTED FROM 6 MILITARY SUBREDDITS. THE POSTS WERE CODED FOR YEAR OF POSTING, SUBREDDIT, AND CONTENT CONSISTENT WITH THE FOLLOWING THEMES: RESOURCES ABOUT SUPPLEMENT SAFETY AND REGULATION, DISCERNABILITY OF SUPPLEMENT USE THROUGH DRUG TESTING, SERIOUS ADVERSE EFFECTS, BRAND NAMES OR IDENTIFIERS, AND REASONS FOR SUPPLEMENT USE. RESULTS: A PRIMARY CONCERN POSTED BY PERSONNEL WHO USED SUPPLEMENTS WAS UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE SUPPLEMENTS THAT WERE NOT DETECTABLE ON A DRUG TEST. SUPPLEMENTS TO IMPROVE WORKOUT PERFORMANCE WERE THE MOST FREQUENTLY USED. CONCLUSIONS: OUR PILOT STUDY SUGGESTS THAT MILITARY PERSONNEL MAY SEEK OUT PEER ADVICE ABOUT WLSP SUPPLEMENTS ON REDDIT AND SPREAD MISINFORMATION ABOUT THE SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE PRODUCTS THROUGH THIS PLATFORM. FUTURE DIRECTIONS FOR THE MONITORING OF WLSP SUPPLEMENT USE IN MILITARY PERSONNEL ARE DISCUSSED. Ã‚Â© 2021 JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH.

226,RADIOTHERAPY OR SURGERY COMPARATIVE QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF ONLINE PATIENT EDUCATION MATERIALS ON PROSTATE CANCER,"AS MULTIPLE DIFFERENT TREATMENT OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE FOR PROSTATE CANCER (PCA) AND YOUTUBE IS COMMONLY USED AS A SOURCE FOR MEDICAL INFORMATION, WE PERFORMED A SYSTEMATIC AND COMPARATIVE ASSESSMENT OF AVAILABLE VIDEOS GUIDING PATIENTS ON THEIR CHOICE FOR THE OPTIMAL TREATMENT. AN INDEPENDENT SEARCH FOR SURGICAL THERAPY OR RADIOTHERAPY OF PCA ON YOUTUBE WAS PERFORMED AND THE 40 MOST VIEWED VIDEOS OF BOTH GROUPS WERE ANALYZED. THE VALIDATED DISCERN QUESTIONNAIRE AND PEMAT WERE UTILIZED TO EVALUATE THEIR QUALITY AND MISINFORMATION. THE MEDIAN OVERALL QUALITY OF THE VIDEOS WAS FOUND TO BE LOW FOR SURGERY VIDEOS, WHILE RADIOTHERAPY VIDEOS RESULTS REACHED A MODERATE QUALITY. THE MEDIAN PEMAT UNDERSTANDABILITY SCORE WAS 60% (RANGE 0Ã¢â‚¬â€œ100%) FOR RADIOTHERAPY AND 75% (RANGE 40Ã¢â‚¬â€œ100) FOR SURGERY VIDEOS. THE RADIOTHERAPY VIDEOS CONTAINED LESS MISINFORMATION AND WERE JUDGED TO BE OF HIGHER QUALITY. SUMMARIZED, THE MAJORITY OF THE PROVIDED VIDEOS OFFER INSUFFICIENT QUALITY OF CONTENT AND ARE POTENTIALLY SUBJECT TO COMMERCIAL BIAS WITHOUT REPORTS ON POSSIBLE CONFLICT OF INTEREST. THUS, MOST OF AVAILABLE VIDEOS ON YOUTUBE INFORMING PCA PATIENTS ABOUT POSSIBLE TREATMENT METHODS ARE NOT SUITED FOR A BALANCED PATIENT EDUCATION OR AS A BASIS FOR THE PATIENTÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S DECISION.

236,US PHYSICIANS AND NURSES MOTIVATIONS BARRIERS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CORRECTING HEALTH MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA QUALITATIVE INTERVIEW STUDY,"BACKGROUND: HEALTH MISINFORMATION IS A PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERN. VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS HAVE CALLED ON HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS, SUCH AS NURSES AND PHYSICIANS, TO BE MORE PROACTIVE IN CORRECTING HEALTH MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY AIMS TO IDENTIFY US PHYSICIANS' AND NURSES' MOTIVATIONS FOR CORRECTING HEALTH MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA, THE BARRIERS THEY FACE IN DOING SO, AND THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS FOR OVERCOMING SUCH BARRIERS. METHODS: IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH 30 PARTICIPANTS, WHICH COMPRISED 15 (50%) REGISTERED NURSES AND 15 (50%) PHYSICIANS. QUALITATIVE DATA WERE ANALYZED BY USING THEMATIC ANALYSIS. RESULTS: PARTICIPANTS WERE PERSONALLY (EG, PERSONAL CHOICE) AND PROFESSIONALLY (EG, TO FULFILL THE RESPONSIBILITY OF A HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL) MOTIVATED TO CORRECT HEALTH MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA. HOWEVER, THEY ALSO FACED INTRAPERSONAL (EG, A LACK OF POSITIVE OUTCOMES AND TIME), INTERPERSONAL (EG, HARASSMENT AND BULLYING), AND INSTITUTIONAL (EG, A LACK OF INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT AND SOCIAL MEDIA TRAINING) BARRIERS TO CORRECTING HEALTH MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA. TO OVERCOME THESE BARRIERS, PARTICIPANTS RECOMMENDED THAT HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS SHOULD RECEIVE MISINFORMATION AND SOCIAL MEDIA TRAINING, INCLUDING BUILDING THEIR SOCIAL MEDIA PRESENCE. CONCLUSIONS: US PHYSICIANS AND NURSES ARE WILLING TO CORRECT HEALTH MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA DESPITE SEVERAL BARRIERS. NONETHELESS, THIS STUDY PROVIDES RECOMMENDATIONS THAT CAN BE USED TO OVERCOME SUCH BARRIERS. OVERALL, THE FINDINGS CAN BE USED BY HEALTH AUTHORITIES AND ORGANIZATIONS TO GUIDE POLICIES AND ACTIVITIES AIMED AT ENCOURAGING MORE HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS TO BE PRESENT ON SOCIAL MEDIA TO COUNTERACT HEALTH MISINFORMATION.

237,NUTRIPEDIA THE FIGHT AGAINST THE FAKE NEWS IN NUTRITION DURING PREGNANCY AND EARLY LIFE,"(1) BACKGROUND. EARLY NUTRITION AND LIFESTYLE BEFORE AND DURING PREGNANCY, BREASTFEEDING, INFANCY, AND EARLY CHILDHOOD CAN AFFECT THE RISK OF DEVELOPING COMMON NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES DURING ADULTHOOD SUCH AS OBESITY AND METABOLIC SYNDROME. TO SUPPORT POSITIVE LONG-TERM OUT-COMES, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO DEBUNK FAKE NEWS AND PROVIDE EVIDENCE-BASED NUTRITIONAL RECOMMENDA-TIONS. Ã¢â‚¬Å“NUTRIPEDIA-INFORMATI PER CRESCEREÃ¢â‚¬Â IS A NEW TOOL DELIVERING INFORMATION AND EDUCATION ON APPROPRIATE NUTRITION OF MOTHERS AND BABIES DURING PREGNANCY AND THE FIRST YEARS OF LIFE. (2) METH-ODS. NUTRIPEDIA PROVIDES THE READERS WITH EVIDENCE-BASED SCIENTIFIC CONTENTS IN AN EASY-TO-ACCESS FASHION THROUGH A WEBSITE, A SOCIAL MEDIA PAGE AND A PERSONALIZED ADVICE APP CALLED Ã¢â‚¬Å“NUTRIPEDIA CHATBOTÃ¢â‚¬Â. (3) RESULTS. FORTY ARTICLES WERE PUBLISHED ON NUTRIPEDIA WEBSITE WITH MORE THAN 220,000 TOTAL VIEWS. SOCIAL CHANNEL ACTIVATION VIA BLOGGERS REACHED OVER 9 MILLION PARENTS. 14,698 USERS DOWNLOADED NUTRIPEDIA CHATBOT, THROUGH WHICH A TOTAL OF 1930 QUESTIONS WERE DIRECTED TO EXPERTS WHILE OVER 24,000 RESPONSES WERE PROVIDED BY THE APP. (4) CONCLUSION. THE USE OF DIFFERENT COMMU-NICATION TOOLS DELIVERING EVIDENCE-BASED NUTRITIONAL INFORMATION SUCH AS NUTRIPEDIA IS INCREASING AND COULD OFFER SUPPORTIVE STRATEGIES TO PROVIDE SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION TO LARGE AUDIENCES AND CON-TRIBUTE FIGHTING FAKE NEWS.

238,CITIZEN PERCEPTIONS OF FAKE NEWS IN SPAIN SOCIOECONOMIC DEMOGRAPHIC AND IDEOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES,"ALTHOUGH THE PHENOMENON OF DISINFORMATION AND, SPECIFICALLY, FAKE NEWS HAS BECOME ESPECIALLY SERIOUS AND PROBLEMATIC, THIS PHENOMENON HAS NOT BEEN WIDELY ADDRESSED IN ACADEMIA FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF CONSUMERS, WHO PLAY A RELEVANT ROLE IN THE SPREAD OF THIS CONTENT. FOR THAT REASON, THE PRESENT STUDY FOCUSES ON DETERMINING HOW THIS PHENOMENON IS PERCEIVED BY CITIZENS, AS THE STRATEGIES TO COUNTERACT FAKE NEWS ARE AFFECTED BY SUCH OPINIONS. THUS, THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO IDENTIFY IN WHICH MEDIA THE PERCEPTION AND EXPERIENCE OF FAKE NEWS IS GREATEST AND THUS DETERMINE WHAT PLATFORMS SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON TO COUNTERACT THIS PHENOMENON. A SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED IN OCTOBER 2020, AMONG THE SPANISH ADULT POPULATION AND WAS COMPLETED BY A TOTAL OF 423 PEOPLE (WITH 421 VALID ANSWERS). AMONG ITS MAIN FINDINGS, THIS STUDY DETERMINED THAT SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS ARE THE TYPE OF MEDIA IN WHICH THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF FAKE NEWS IS PERCEIVED, WHICH CONFIRMS THE SUGGESTIONS OF PREVIOUS STUDIES. FURTHERMORE, THE EXPERIENCED PRESENCE OF FAKE NEWS SEEMS TO BE PRIMARILY AFFECTED BY AGE AND GENDER, AS THERE WAS A HIGHER LEVEL OF SKEPTICISM OBSERVED AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE AND WOMEN.

239,YOUTUBE AS A SOURCE OF INFORMATION ON GONADOTROPIN SELFINJECTIONS,"OBJECTIVE: TO INVESTIGATE THE COMPREHENSIVENESS, QUALITY, AND RELIABILITY OF YOUTUBE VIDEOS THAT TARGET TEACHING PATIENTS GONADOTROPIN SELF-INJECTIONS. STUDY DESIGN: VIDEOS DEMONSTRATING GONADOTROPIN SELF-INJECTIONS WERE SEARCHED USING THE KEYWORDS Ã¢â‚¬Å“GONAL-F INJECTION,Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬Å“PUREGON INJECTION,Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬Å“MENAPUR INJECTION,Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬Å“MERIONAL INJECTION,Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬Å“FOSTIMON INJECTION,Ã¢â‚¬Â AND Ã¢â‚¬Å“MENAGON INJECTION,Ã¢â‚¬Â ON DECEMBER 20TH, 2020. THE VIDEOS WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO CATEGORIES AS INCLUDING Ã¢â‚¬Å“USEFUL INFORMATIONÃ¢â‚¬Â AND Ã¢â‚¬Å“MISLEADING INFORMATIONÃ¢â‚¬Â BY TWO PHYSICIANS. A 5-POINT GLOBAL QUALITY SCALE (GQS) AND 5-POINT MODIFIED DISCERN SCALE WERE USED FOR THE ASSESSMENTS OF QUALITY AND RELIABILITY, RESPECTIVELY. RESULTS: AMONG 110 VIDEOS, 90 (81.8%) WERE FOUND TO INCLUDE USEFUL INFORMATION AND 20 (18.2%) WERE FOUND TO GIVE MISLEADING INFORMATION. THE KAPPA STATISTIC FOR INTER-OBSERVER AGREEMENT WAS 0.817 (P < 0.001). USEFUL VIDEOS WERE THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE AND HAD THE HIGHEST RELIABILITY AND QUALITY SCORES. WE FOUND THAT ALL VIDEOS UPLOADED BY UNIVERSITIES OR PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDED USEFUL INFORMATION. HOWEVER, THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN USEFUL AND MISLEADING VIDEOS REGARDING AUDIENCE INTERACTION ANALYSIS PARAMETERS (P > 0.05). ON THE OTHER HAND, MEAN RELIABILITY, GQS, AND COMPREHENSIVENESS SCORES WERE HIGHER IN THE USEFUL INFORMATION GROUP THAN IN THE OTHER GROUP. AS THE SUBGROUP ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED BY SOURCE, PATIENT OPINION VIDEOS HAD LOWER RELIABILITY, COMPREHENSIVENESS, AND GQS SCORES THAN VIDEOS CREATED BY OTHER SOURCES (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: OUR ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT THERE WERE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF ENGLISH-LANGUAGE YOUTUBE VIDEOS, WITH HIGH QUALITY, RICH CONTENT, AND RELIABILITY THAT COULD BE SOURCES OF INFORMATION ON THE ACCURATE TECHNIQUE OF GONADOTROPIN SELF-INJECTIONS. HOWEVER, SOME MISLEADING INFORMATION VIDEOS MAY LEAD TO NEGATIVE OUTCOMES. THEREFORE, PHYSICIANS SHOULD ENSURE THAT ONLINE SOURCES ARE COMPREHENSIVE AND RELIABLE FOR THE USE OF THEIR PATIENTS WITH INFERTILITY. ALSO, YOUTUBE HEALTH VIDEOS SHOULD BE CHECKED FOR BOTH RELIABILITY AND ETHICAL STANDARDS.

THIS STUDY ALSO ANALYSES THE LEVEL OF NEW MEDIA LITERACY AMONG YOUNG ADULTS TO PROCESS FAKE NEWS ON SOCIAL MEDIA. A QUANTITATIVE DATA COLLECTION METHOD USING QUESTIONNAIRES WAS USED TO COLLECT DATA FROM 450 YOUNG ADULTS. RESULTS SHOWED THAT DESPITE BEING CONFIDENT OF BEING ABLE TO DISTINGUISH FAKE NEWS FROM REAL NEWS, YOUNG ADULTS HAVE DIFFICULTIES TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN VERIFIABLE NEWS AND FAKE NEWS. RESPONDENTS ARE ALSO PROACTIVE IN COMBATTING THE SPREAD OF FAKE NEWS, WHERE A LARGE PERCENTAGE WOULD RE-SHARE THE POST TO NOTIFY OTHER USERS.

255,MEMETICS OF DECEPTION SPREADING LOCAL MEME HOAXES DURING COVID19 1ST YEAR,"THE CENTRAL THESIS OF THIS PAPER IS THAT MEMETIC PRACTICES CAN BE CRUCIAL TO UNDERSTANDING DECEPTION AT PRESENT WHEN HOAXES HAVE INCREASED GLOBALLY DUE TO COVID-19. THEREFORE, WE EMPLOY EXISTING MEMETIC THEORY TO DESCRIBE THE QUALITIES AND CHARACTERISTICS OF MEME HOAXES IN TERMS OF THE WAY THEY ARE REPLICATED BY ALTERING SOME ASPECTS OF THE ORIGINAL, AND THEN SHARED ON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS IN ORDER TO CONNECT GLOBAL AND LOCAL ISSUES. CRITERIA FOR SELECTING THE SAMPLE WERE HOAXES RETRIEVED FROM AND RELATED TO THE LOCAL TERRITORY IN THE PROVINCE OF ALICANTE (SPAIN) DURING THE FIRST YEAR OF THE PANDEMIC (N = 35). ONCE TYPOLOGY, HOAX TOPICS AND THEIR MEMETIC QUALITIES WERE IDENTIFIED, WE ANALYSED THEIR CHARACTERISTICS ACCORDING TO FORM IN TERMS OF SHIFMAN (2014) AND, SECONDLY, THEIR CONTENT AND STANCE CONCORDANCES BOTH WITHIN AND OUTSIDE OUR SAMPLE (SPAIN AND ABROAD). THE RESULTS SHOW, FIRSTLY, THAT HOAXES ARE MAINLY DISINFORMATION AND THEY ARE RELATED TO THE PANDEMIC. SECONDLY, DESPITE THE NOTION THAT LOCAL HOAXES ARE LINKED TO LOCAL CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO EXTRAPOLATE, OUR CONCLUSIONS DEMONSTRATE THEIR EXTRAORDINARY MEMETIC AND Ã¢â‚¬Å“GLOCALÃ¢â‚¬Â CAPACITY: THEY RAPIDLY ADAPT OTHER HOAXES FROM OTHER PLACES TO LOCAL AREAS, VERY OFTEN SUPPLANTING RELIABLE SOURCES, AND THEREBY DEMONSTRATING CONSISTENCY AND OPPORTUNISM.

262,AMBIENT AFFILIATION MISINFORMATION AND MORAL PANIC NEGOTIATING SOCIAL BONDS IN A YOUTUBE INTERNET HOAX,"DECEPTIVE COMMUNICATION AND MISINFORMATION ARE CRUCIAL ISSUES THAT ARE CURRENTLY HAVING A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON SOCIAL LIFE. PARALLEL TO THE IMPORTANT WORK OF IDENTIFYING MISINFORMATION ON DIGITAL PLATFORMS IS UNDERSTANDING WHY SUCH MATERIAL PROLIFERATES. ONE APPROACH TO ANSWERING THIS QUESTION IS TO ATTEMPT TO UNDERSTAND THE VALUES THAT ARE BEING TARGETED BY MISINFORMATION AS A MEANS OF INTERPRETING THE UNDERLYING SOCIAL BONDS THAT ARE AT STAKE. THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE KINDS OF SOCIAL BONDS THAT ARE COMMUNED AROUND AND CONTESTED IN A CORPUS OF YOUTUBE VIDEO COMMENTS ABOUT THE VIRAL INTERNET HOAX Ã¢â‚¬ËœTHE MOMO CHALLENGEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. A SOCIAL SEMIOTIC APPROACH TO Ã¢â‚¬ËœAMBIENT AFFILIATIONÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (ZAPPAVIGNA, 2011) IS USED TO INVESTIGATE HOW THESE BONDS ARE NEGOTIATED IN THIS DIGITAL DISCOURSE.

THE 16 EXPERIMENTAL TWEETS VARIED FOUR MESSAGING ELEMENTS: MISINFORMATION (MISINFORMATION OR NOT), SOURCE (PERSON OR ORGANIZATION), NARRATIVE STYLE (STORYTELLING OR SCIENTIFIC DATA), AND TOPIC (EFFECTIVENESS OR SAFETY). PARENTS REPORTED THEIR MOTIVATION TO VACCINATE (PRIMARY OUTCOME), TRUST IN SOCIAL MEDIA CONTENT, AND PERCEIVED RISK ABOUT HPV-RELATED DISEASES. TWEETS WITHOUT MISINFORMATION ELICITED HIGHER HPV VACCINE MOTIVATION THAN TWEETS WITH MISINFORMATION (25% VS. 5%, OR = 6.60, 95% CI:4.05, https://doi.org/10.75). MOTIVATION WAS HIGHER FOR TWEETS FROM ORGANIZATIONS VERSUS PERSONS (20% VS. 10%, OR = 2.47, 95% CI:1.52, 4.03) AND ABOUT EFFECTIVENESS VERSUS SAFETY (20% VS. 10%, OR = 2.03, 95% CI:1.24, 3.30). TWEETS WITH MISINFORMATION PRODUCED LOWER TRUST AND HIGHER PERCEIVED RISK (BOTH P <.01), WITH IMPACT VARYING DEPENDING ON SOURCE AND TOPIC.

270,EXPLORING LIGHTWEIGHT INTERVENTIONS AT POSTING TIME TO REDUCE THE SHARING OF MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA,"WHEN USERS ON SOCIAL MEDIA SHARE CONTENT WITHOUT CONSIDERING ITS VERACITY, THEY MAY UNWITTINGLY BE SPREADING MISINFORMATION. IN THIS WORK, WE INVESTIGATE THE DESIGN OF LIGHTWEIGHT INTERVENTIONS THAT NUDGE USERS TO ASSESS THE ACCURACY OF INFORMATION AS THEY SHARE IT. SUCH ASSESSMENT MAY DETER USERS FROM POSTING MISINFORMATION IN THE FIRST PLACE, AND THEIR ASSESSMENTS MAY ALSO PROVIDE USEFUL GUIDANCE TO FRIENDS AIMING TO ASSESS THOSE POSTS THEMSELVES. IN SUPPORT OF LIGHTWEIGHT ASSESSMENT, WE FIRST DEVELOP A TAXONOMY OF THE REASONS WHY PEOPLE BELIEVE A NEWS CLAIM IS OR IS NOT TRUE; THIS TAXONOMY YIELDS A CHECKLIST THAT CAN BE USED AT POSTING TIME. WE CONDUCT EVALUATIONS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE CHECKLIST IS AN ACCURATE AND COMPREHENSIVE ENCAPSULATION OF PEOPLE'S FREE-RESPONSE RATIONALES. IN A SECOND EXPERIMENT, WE STUDY THE EFFECTS OF THREE BEHAVIORAL NUDGES - -1) CHECKBOXES INDICATING WHETHER HEADINGS ARE ACCURATE, 2) TAGGING REASONS (FROM OUR TAXONOMY) THAT A POST IS ACCURATE VIA A CHECKLIST AND 3) PROVIDING FREE-TEXT RATIONALES FOR WHY A HEADLINE IS OR IS NOT ACCURATE - -ON PEOPLE'S INTENTION OF SHARING THE HEADLINE ON SOCIAL MEDIA. FROM AN EXPERIMENT WITH 1668 PARTICIPANTS, WE FIND THAT BOTH PROVIDING ACCURACY ASSESSMENT AND RATIONALE REDUCE THE SHARING OF FALSE CONTENT. THEY ALSO REDUCE THE SHARING OF TRUE CONTENT, BUT TO A LESSER DEGREE THAT YIELDS AN OVERALL DECREASE IN THE FRACTION OF SHARED CONTENT THAT IS FALSE.

BETWEEN JULY AND AUGUST 2019, WE CONDUCTED A WEB-BASED SURVEY WITH A NATIONAL SAMPLE OF 1073 PARENTS OF ADOLESCENTS AND WHO USE SOCIAL MEDIA. THE SURVEY ASSESSED SUPPORT FOR TEN STANDARDS ABOUT VACCINE MISINFORMATION. MULTIVARIABLE LOGISTIC REGRESSION ASSESSED CORRELATES OF SUPPORT. OVERALL, 61% OF PARENTS SUPPORTED AT LEAST ONE STANDARD. SUPPORT FOR EACH STANDARD VARIED GREATLY (12Ã¢â‚¬â€œ51%), WITH HIGHER SUPPORT FOR LESS RESTRICTIVE STANDARDS. PARENTS MORE OFTEN SUPPORTED STANDARDS IF THEIR CHILD HAD ALREADY INITIATED HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS (HPV) VACCINATION, IF THEY WERE NON-HISPANIC BLACK OR HISPANIC, IF THEY AGREED THAT VACCINE MISINFORMATION IS HARMFUL, OR IF THEY SAW INFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA IN FAVOR OF HPV VACCINE (ALL P < .05).

THE SPREAD OF MISINFORMATION IN SOCIAL NETWORKS HAS ALSO BECOME A WIDESPREAD CONCERN AMONG SCHOLARS. IN THE STUDY, WE TOOK THE MISINFORMATION SPREAD ON SOCIAL MEDIA AS THE RESEARCH OBJECT AND COMPARED IT WITH TRUE INFORMATION TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SPREAD OF MISINFORMATION IN SOCIAL NETWORKS. THIS STUDY ADOPTS A DEEP LEARNING METHOD TO PERFORM CONTENT ANALYSIS AND EMOTION ANALYSIS ON MISINFORMATION DATASET AND TRUE INFORMATION DATASET AND ADOPTS AN ANALYTIC NETWORK PROCESS TO ANALYZE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MISINFORMATION AND TRUE INFORMATION IN TERMS OF NETWORK DIFFUSION CHARACTERISTICS. THE RESEARCH FINDINGS REVEAL THAT THE SPREAD OF MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA IS INFLUENCED BY CONTENT FEATURES AND DIFFERENT EMOTIONS AND CONSEQUENTLY PRODUCES DIFFERENT CHANGES.

THERE HAS BEEN, HOWEVER, NO RESEARCH ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CORRECTION MESSAGES ON FALSEHOODS AND THEIR DYNAMIC INTERACTION. WE DEVELOP A THEORETICAL MODEL OF THE COMPETITION BETWEEN FALSEHOODS AND CORRECTION MESSAGES ON TWITTER AND SHOW DIFFERENT INTERVENTIONS UNDER WHICH FALSEHOODS COULD BE HAMPERED. MOREOVER, WE USE PANEL VECTOR AUTOREGRESSIVE MODELS AND MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES TO EMPIRICALLY INVESTIGATE THE DYNAMIC INTERACTIONS BETWEEN FALSEHOODS AND CORRECTION MESSAGES THROUGH A UNIQUE LONGITUDINAL DATASET OF 279,597 TWEETS. WE FIND THAT CORRECTION MESSAGES CAUSE AN INCREASE IN THE PROPAGATION OF FALSEHOODS ON SOCIAL MEDIA IF THEIR USE IS NOT OPTIMIZED. THIS STUDY HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, FACT-CHECKING WEBSITES, AND SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS WORK TOGETHER TO OPTIMIZE EFFECTIVE CORRECTION MESSAGES.

311,EMOTIONS THE UNEXPLORED FUEL OF FAKE NEWS ON SOCIAL MEDIA,"EASY ACCESS TO EQUIPMENT, SOFTWARE, AND PLATFORMS TO CREATE, DISTRIBUTE, AND PROVIDE ACCESS TO FAKE NEWS STORIES HAS EXACERBATED THE PROBLEM OF FAKE NEWS, MAKING FOR A LARGE NUMBER OF HIGHLY BIASED SOURCES THAT ARE REACHING THE MAINSTREAM THROUGH SOCIAL NETWORKS. THE ECONOMICS OF EMOTION THEORY PROPOSES THAT FAKE NEWS HEADLINES ARE CREATED TO EVOKE EMOTIONAL RESPONSES IN READERS THAT WILL CAUSE THEM TO INTERACT WITH THE ARTICLE IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS THE CREATOR TO MAKE A PROFIT (THROUGH CLICKING ON THE LINK TO THE FULL ARTICLE, BY SHARING THE ARTICLE, ETC.). THIS MIXED METHODS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE PROCESS BY WHICH INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCE DISCRETE EMOTIONAL REACTIONS TO FAKE NEWS HEADLINES, AND HOW THESE EMOTIONS CONTRIBUTE TO THE PERPETUATION OF FAKE NEWS THROUGH SHARING BEHAVIORS. U.S. PARTICIPANTS (N=879 ACROSS TWO WAVES) VIEWED ONE OF EIGHT FALSE NEWS HEADLINES AND REPORTED THEIR EMOTIONAL REACTIONS, BELIEF IN THE HEADLINE, AND POTENTIAL SHARING BEHAVIORS. IN GENERAL, PARTICIPANTS WERE MORE LIKELY TO BELIEVE HEADLINES THAT ALIGNED WITH THEIR EXISTING BELIEFS (E.G., LIBERALS WERE MORE LIKELY TO BELIEVE NEGATIVE NEWS ABOUT CONSERVATIVES), REACTED WITH MORE NEGATIVE EMOTIONS TO HEADLINES THAT ATTACKED THEIR PARTY, AND WERE MORE LIKELY TO REPORT INTENTIONS TO SUPPRESS (E.G., POST A LINK TO A FACT CHECK) FAKE NEWS THAT ATTACKED THEIR OWN PARTY. EMOTIONAL REACTIVITY OF PARTICIPANTS WAS ASSOCIATED WITH RESPONSE BEHAVIOR INTENTIONS SUCH THAT PARTICIPANTS WHO REPORTED HIGH LEVELS OF EMOTIONS WERE MORE LIKELY TO TAKE ACTIONS THAT WOULD SPREAD OR SUPPRESS THE FAKE NEWS, PARTICIPANTS WHO REPORTED LOW LEVELS OF EMOTIONS WERE MORE LIKELY TO IGNORE OR DISENGAGE FROM THE SPREAD OF FALSE NEWS, AND PARTICIPANTS WHO REPORTED HIGH LEVELS OF NEGATIVE EMOTIONS AND LOW LEVELS OF POSITIVE EMOTIONS WERE MORE LIKELY TO SUPPRESS THE SPREAD OF FAKE NEWS AND LESS LIKELY TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE SPREAD OF FAKE NEWS. OUR FINDINGS ARE SYNTHESIZED INTO A PROCESS MODEL THAT EXPLAINS HOW DISCRETE EMOTIONS AND BELIEFS INFLUENCE SHARING BEHAVIORS. IMPLICATIONS FOR MITIGATING THE SPREAD OF FAKE NEWS ARE DISCUSSED IN TERMS OF THIS MODEL.

312,CURE OR POISON IDENTITY VERIFICATION AND THE POSTING OF FAKE NEWS ON SOCIAL MEDIA,"THE PROLIFERATION OF FAKE NEWS ON SOCIAL MEDIA HAS BECOME A MAJOR SOCIETAL AND POLITICAL PROBLEM. MEANWHILE, SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS HAVE STARTED TO REQUIRE IDENTITY VERIFICATION FROM USERS AND LABEL THE VERIFIED USERS WITH A VERIFICATION BADGE, MAKING USERS MORE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR ONLINE BEHAVIOR. IN THIS STUDY, WE EMPIRICALLY INVESTIGATE TWO RESEARCH QUESTIONS: 1) WHAT IS THE IMPACT OF IDENTITY VERIFICATION ON USERSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ PROPENSITY TO POST FAKE NEWS? AND 2) HOW DOES A VERIFICATION BADGE MODERATE THE IMPACT OF IDENTITY VERIFICATION? RESULTS SUGGEST THAT WHILE IDENTITY VERIFICATION WITHOUT A VERIFICATION BADGE HAS A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON USERSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ POSTING OF FAKE NEWS, THIS IMPACT IS SIGNIFICANTLY WEAKENED WHEN USERS ARE GRANTED A VERIFICATION BADGE AFTER IDENTITY VERIFICATION. GIVEN THE CRITICISMS ON IDENTITY VERIFICATION POLICIES, THESE FINDINGS UNDERSCORE BOTH THE POTENTIAL UPSIDES AND RISKS FOR SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS SEEKING TO COMBAT FAKE NEWS THROUGH IDENTITY VERIFICATION TECHNIQUES.

313,BIASED CREDIBILITY AND SHARING OF FAKE NEWS ON SOCIAL MEDIA CONSIDERING PEER CONTEXT AND SELFOBJECTIVITY STATE,"SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED THE CONSUMPTION AND SPREAD OF FAKE NEWS ON SOCIAL MEDIA. TWO NOTABLE GAPS, THOUGH, EXIST IN THE EXTANT LITERATURE. FIRST, PRIOR RESEARCH HAS FOCUSED ON THE POLITICAL ORIENTATION OF USERS WHILE IGNORING THE BROADER CONTEXT OF SHARING, NAMELY THE PERCEIVED POLITICAL ORIENTATION OF THEIR SOCIAL MEDIA PEERS. SECOND, THERE IS LIMITED INSIGHT ABOUT HOW USER STATES, ESPECIALLY THOSE RELATED TO THEIR JUDGMENT ABILITIES, INFLUENCE THE CRITICAL EVALUATION OF FAKE NEWS ON SOCIAL MEDIA. THIS PAPER ADDRESSES THESE GAPS BY THEORIZING THE ROLES OF PERCEIVED PEER POLITICAL ORIENTATION AND SELF-OBJECTIVITY STATES OF USERS IN TRANSLATING BIASED CREDIBILITY ASSESSMENTS OF FAKE NEWS INTO BIASED SHARING INTENTIONS. IT REPORTS ON AN 7EXPERIMENT (N=408) THAT PRIMED SELF-PERCEIVED OBJECTIVITY (A STATE) IN HALF OF THE PARTICIPANTS TO EXAMINE ITS EFFICACY IN MODERATING THE INFLUENCE OF CREDIBILITY BIAS (THE EXTENT TO WHICH USERS BELIEVE THE NEWS THAT HIGHLIGHT IDEAS THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH THEIR POLITICAL ORIENTATION MORE THAN FAKE NEWS ARTICLES THAT HIGHLIGHT IDEAS THAT ARE INCONSISTENT WITH THEIR POLITICAL ORIENTATION) ON SHARING BIAS (THE EXTENT TO WHICH THEY ARE LIKELY TO SHARE FAKE NEWS THAT HIGHLIGHT IDEAS THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH THEIR POLITICAL ORIENTATION MORE THAN FAKE NEWS THAT HIGHLIGHT IDEAS THAT ARE INCONSISTENT WITH THEIR POLITICAL ORIENTATION) WHILE ACCOUNTING FOR THE MODERATING EFFECT OF PERCEIVED PEER POLITICAL ORIENTATION (A CONTEXTUAL FACTOR). WE FOUND THAT CONSISTENCY OF FAKE NEWS WITH PEOPLEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S POLITICAL ORIENTATION INCREASED CREDIBILITY BIAS AND SHARING BIAS AND THAT CREDIBILITY BIAS INCREASED SHARING BIAS. WE ALSO FOUND THAT PERCEIVED ALIGNMENT BETWEEN A USER AND THEIR PEERSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ POLITICAL ORIENTATION, AS A SOCIAL CONTEXT, REDUCED THE EFFECT OF CREDIBILITY BIAS ON SHARING BIAS. FINALLY, WE FOUND MIXED SUPPORT FOR THE MODERATING EFFECTS OF PRIMED SELF-OBJECTIVITY ON THE INFLUENCE OF CREDIBILITY BIAS ON SHARING BIAS; IT AFFECTED ONLY LIBERAL-LEANING PARTICIPANTS.

314,THE EFFECT OF PLATFORM INTERVENTION POLICIES ON FAKE NEWS DISSEMINATION AND SURVIVAL AN EMPIRICAL EXAMINATION,"FAKE NEWS ON SOCIAL MEDIA HAS BECOME A SERIOUS PROBLEM, AND SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS HAVE STARTED TO ACTIVELY IMPLEMENT VARIOUS INTERVENTIONS TO MITIGATE ITS IMPACT. THIS PAPER FOCUSES ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TWO PLATFORM INTERVENTIONS, NAMELY A CONTENT-LEVEL INTERVENTION (I.E., A FAKE NEWS FLAG THAT APPLIES TO A SINGLE POST) AND AN ACCOUNT-LEVEL INTERVENTION (I.E., A FORWARDING RESTRICTION POLICY THAT APPLIES TO THE ENTIRE ACCOUNT). COLLECTING DATA FROM CHINAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S LARGEST SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM, WE STUDY THE IMPACT OF A FAKE NEWS FLAG ON THREE FAKE NEWS DISSEMINATION PATTERNS USING A PROPENSITY SCORE MATCHING METHOD WITH A DIFFERENCE-IN-DIFFERENCES APPROACH. WE FIND THAT IMPLEMENTING A POLICY OF USING FAKE NEWS FLAG INFLUENCES THE DISSEMINATION OF FAKE NEWS IN A MORE CENTRALIZED MANNER VIA DIRECT FORWARDS AND IN A LESS DISPERSED MANNER VIA INDIRECT FORWARDS, AND THAT FAKE NEWS POSTS ARE FORWARDED MORE OFTEN BY INFLUENTIAL USERS. IN ADDITION, COMPARED WITH TRUTHFUL NEWS, FAKE NEWS IS DISSEMINATED IN A LESS CENTRALIZED AND MORE DISPERSED MANNER AND SURVIVES FOR A SHORTER PERIOD AFTER A FORWARDING RESTRICTION POLICY IS IMPLEMENTED. THIS STUDY PROVIDES CAUSAL EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE OF THE EFFECT OF A FAKE NEWS FLAG ON FAKE NEWS DISSEMINATION. WE ALSO EXPAND THE LITERATURE ON PLATFORM INTERVENTIONS TO COMBAT FAKE NEWS BY INVESTIGATING A LESS STUDIED ACCOUNT-LEVEL INTERVENTION.

OPTOMETRISTS SHOULD BE AWARE OF MISLEADING INFORMATION FROM ONLINE PLATFORMS WHEN PROVIDING INFORMATION TO KERATOCONUS PATIENTS. BACKGROUND: KERATOCONUS IS A PROGRESSIVE CORNEAL DISEASE CHARACTERISED BY STROMAL THINNING AND CORNEAL ECTASIA. TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE, THERE IS NO STUDY EVALUATING THE POPULARITY, QUALITY, AND RELIABILITY OF VIDEOS ABOUT KERATOCONUS DISEASE AND ITS TREATMENT PUBLISHED ON YOUTUBE. IN OUR STUDY, WE AIMED TO EVALUATE THE CREDIBILITY, QUALITY, AND POPULARITY OF YOUTUBE VIDEOS ABOUT KERATOCONUS. METHODS: THIS IS A RETROSPECTIVE, CROSS-SECTIONAL, REGISTER-BASED STUDY. A YOUTUBE SEARCH WAS PERFORMED USING THE KEYWORDS Ã¢â‚¬ËœKERATOCONUSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœKERATOCONUS DISEASEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœKERATOCONUS TREATMENTÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœKERATOCONUS CROSS LINKINGÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. THE QUALITY AND RELIABILITY OF VIDEO CONTENT WERE MEASURED USING THE DISCERN QUESTIONNAIRE, THE JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION (JAMA) SCORE, AND THE GLOBAL QUALITY SCORE (GQS). THE VIDEO POWER INDEX WAS USED TO EVALUATE THE POPULARITY OF THE VIDEOS. RESULTS: ONE HUNDRED VIDEOS WERE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY. THE AVERAGE DURATION WAS 6.33Ã‚Â MIN AND AVERAGE TOTAL NUMBER OF VIEWS WAS 14,940. THE MEAN DISCERN, JAMA, AND GQS SCORES WERE 42.57Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 12.04 (INTERMEDIATE QUALITY), 1.77Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 0.51 (POOR QUALITY), AND 3.63Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 1.03 (INTERMEDIATE QUALITY), RESPECTIVELY.

318,MEASURING PERSONAL AND ACADEMIC DIFFERENCES IN STUDENTS PERCEIVED SOCIAL MEDIA CREDIBILITY,"PURPOSE: SOCIAL MEDIA IS A POPULAR SOURCE FOR INFORMATION SHARING IN THE CONTEMPORARY WORLD. SOCIAL MEDIA ALLOW INDIVIDUALS TO CREATE, PUBLISH AND DIFFUSE CONTENTS DIRECTLY. THIS OPENNESS HAS INCREASED THE RISK OF RUNNING INTO MISINFORMATION AND RAISED QUESTIONS ABOUT CREDIBILITY OF INFORMATION SHARED. THIS STUDY AIMS TO EXAMINE THE CREDIBILITY OF SOCIAL MEDIA THROUGH THE PERCEPTIONS OF UNIVERSITY STUDENTS. IT ALSO INTENDS TO SEE THE DIFFERENCE IN OPINIONS BASED ON THEIR GENDER, ACADEMIC DISCIPLINES AND PROGRAMS OF STUDY. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: THE STUDY WAS BASED ON A CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY; A STRUCTURED QUESTIONNAIRE WAS DEVELOPED BY CONSULTING THE RELEVANT LITERATURE. STUDENTS WERE SELECTED ON CONVENIENT BASIS FROM ALL THE PROGRAMS OF FOUR UNIVERSITIES OF FAISALABAD, PAKISTAN. FOUR HUNDRED STUDENTS WERE SELECTED RANDOMLY FROM EACH UNIVERSITY. FINDINGS: THE FINDINGS INDICATED THAT STUDENTS CONSIDERED SOCIAL MEDIA PARTIALLY CREDIBLE. CURRENCY, COMMUNITY WELLNESS, UNDERSTANDABILITY AND COMPLETENESS OF INFORMATION WERE THE HIGHLY RATED FACETS, WHILE FACTUAL AND UNBIASED INFORMATION WAS THE LOW RATED ASPECTS. THE PERCEIVED CREDIBILITY OF SOCIAL MEDIA AMONG THE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS WAS THE SAME ACROSS GENDERS, PROGRAMS OF STUDY AND ACADEMIC DISCIPLINES. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: THE STUDY MAY BE HELPFUL FOR SOCIAL MEDIA SERVICE PROVIDERS TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT STUDENTS HAD IN THEIR PERCEPTION REGARDING ITS CREDIBILITY. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: THIS STUDY MAY LIKELY BENEFIT FACULTY MEMBERS, RESEARCHERS, LIBRARIANS/INFORMATION PROFESSIONALS AND DIGITAL LIBRARIES TO UNDERSTAND THE STUDENTSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ CONCERNS ABOUT SOCIAL MEDIA CREDIBILITY FROM A DEVELOPING COUNTRYÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S PERSPECTIVE. SUCH UNDERSTANDING WILL ENABLE THEM TO BETTER ADDRESS, EDUCATE AND TRAIN UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AT HOW TO EVALUATE THE QUALITY OF INFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA BY OFFERING INFORMATION LITERACY PROGRAMS. IT IS DIRELY NEEDED THAT UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES SHOULD TRAIN THE STUDENTS TO BE PROFICIENT IN ASSESSING THE QUALITY OF INFORMATION BY OFFERING INFORMATION OR DIGITAL LITERACY PROGRAMS.

USING A MIXED METHOD, THE STUDY'S FINDINGS SHOW THAT THERE IS A CLEAR POLITICALLY POLARIZED DISCUSSION ON CLIMATE CHANGE. WE FOUND THAT THE MAJORITY OF TWEETS FOCUS ON THE UNITEDSTATES CONTEXT THOUGH REFERENCES TO OTHER WESTERN COUTNRIES ARE OFTEN MADE. THE ANTI-LIBERAL OR ANTI-DEMOCRATIC ONLINE COMMUNITY WAS MORE ACTIVE ON TWITTER THAN THE ANTI-CONSERVATIVE OR ANTI-REPUBLICAN COMMUNITY.

SCHOLARS HAVE FOUND THAT JOURNALISTS HAVE TURNED SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS INTO ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS OF THEIR PROFESSIONAL OPERATIONS. HOWEVER, THE EXTENT TO WHICH JOURNALISTS ENGAGE IN DEBUNKING MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA IS STILL UNCLEAR. BY CONDUCTING A U.S. NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE SURVEY WITH MORE THAN 400 JOURNALISTS, THIS STUDY DELVES INTO JOURNALISTSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ PERCEPTIONS OF FALSE INFORMATION, SOCIAL MEDIA USE, AND DEBUNKING ACTIONS TO EXPOSE MISLEADING CONTENT IN ONLINE CONTEXTS. OUR FINDINGS INDICATE LOW LEVELS OF DEBUNKING, ALTHOUGH WE FOUND FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH JOURNALISTS EITHER CONFRONTING OR REPORTING MISINFORMATION. ON THE ONE HAND, JOURNALISTS WHO USE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS TO DEVELOP THEIR BRANDS AND ENGAGE DIRECTLY WITH THEIR AUDIENCES ARE MORE LIKELY TO PUBLICLY CONFRONT MISINFORMATION. ON THE OTHER HAND, JOURNALISTS WHO BELIEVE SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE SPREAD OF FAKE NEWS DO NOT ENGAGE DIRECTLY IN CONFRONTING FALSE INFORMATION, BUT DO REPORT IT WHEN THEY ENCOUNTER IT.

USERSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ ROLE IN DISSEMINATING FAKE NEWS HAS BECOME INEVITABLE WITH THE INCREASE IN POPULARITY OF SOCIAL MEDIA FOR DAILY NEWS DIET. PEOPLE IN SOCIAL MEDIA ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE IN THE CREATION AND PROPAGATION OF NEWS, FAVORING THE PROLIFERATION OF FAKE NEWS INTENTIONALLY OR UNINTENTIONALLY. THUS, IT IS NECESSARY TO IDENTIFY THE USERS WHO TEND TO SHARE FAKE NEWS TO MITIGATE THE RAMPANT DISSEMINATION OF FAKE NEWS OVER SOCIAL MEDIA. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE PERFORM A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS ON TWO DIFFERENT DATASETS COLLECTED FROM TWITTER AND INVESTIGATE THE PATTERNS OF USER CHARACTERISTICS IN SOCIAL MEDIA IN THE PRESENCE OF MISINFORMATION. SPECIFICALLY, WE STUDY THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE USER CHARACTERISTICS AND THEIR LIKELIHOOD OF BEING FAKE NEWS SPREADERS AND DEMONSTRATE THE POTENTIAL OF THE PROPOSED FEATURES IN IDENTIFYING FAKE NEWS SPREADERS.

329,UNDERSTANDING RUMOR COMBATING BEHAVIOR ON SOCIAL MEDIA,"SOCIAL MEDIA SERVICES BECOME A HOTBED FOR RUMORS AND LIES DURING HEALTH CRISES SUCH AS THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. WHILE PREVIOUS LITERATURE STUDIES THE NEGATIVE ROLE THAT SOCIAL MEDIA USERS PLAY IN SPREADING RUMORS DURING CRISES, THIS STUDY EXPLORES HOW USERS CAN BE MOTIVATED TO COMBAT COVID-19 RUMORS. WE BUILD A RESEARCH MODEL THAT IS BASED ON THE AWARENESS-MOTIVATION-CAPABILITY FRAMEWORK AND EMPIRICALLY TEST OUR MODEL USING DATA COLLECTED FROM 279 CHINESE SOCIAL MEDIA USERS. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT RUMOR COMBATING BEHAVIOR, DEFINED AS USERSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ ACTIONS TO DISCOURAGE OTHERS FROM SHARING INFORMATION FROM UNVERIFIED SOURCES, IS INFLUENCED DIRECTLY BY THE PERSONAL NORM, ALTRUISM, SOCIAL TIES, AND KNOWLEDGE, AND INDIRECTLY BY PERCEIVED SEVERITY AND PERCEIVED VULNERABILITY THROUGH THE PERSONAL NORM.

330,INVESTIGATING DYNAMIC RELATIONS BETWEEN FACTUAL INFORMATION AND MISINFORMATION EMPIRICAL STUDIES OF TWEETS RELATED TO PREVENTION MEASURES DURING COVID19,"DURING COVID-19, MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA HAS AFFECTED PEOPLE'S ADOPTION OF APPROPRIATE PREVENTION BEHAVIORS. ALTHOUGH AN ARRAY OF APPROACHES HAVE BEEN PROPOSED TO SUPPRESS MISINFORMATION, FEW HAVE INVESTIGATED THE ROLE OF DISSEMINATING FACTUAL INFORMATION DURING CRISES. NONE HAS EXAMINED ITS EFFECT ON SUPPRESSING MISINFORMATION QUANTITATIVELY USING LONGITUDINAL SOCIAL MEDIA DATA. THEREFORE, THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE TEMPORAL CORRELATIONS BETWEEN FACTUAL INFORMATION AND MISINFORMATION, AND INTENDS TO ANSWER WHETHER PREVIOUSLY PREDOMINANT FACTUAL INFORMATION CAN SUPPRESS MISINFORMATION. IT FOCUSES ON TWO PREVENTION MEASURES, THAT IS, WEARING MASKS AND SOCIAL DISTANCING, USING TWEETS COLLECTED FROM APRIL 3 TO JUNE 30, 2020, IN THE UNITED STATES. WE TRAINED SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE CLASSIFIERS TO RETRIEVE RELEVANT TWEETS AND CLASSIFY TWEETS CONTAINING FACTUAL INFORMATION AND MISINFORMATION FOR EACH TOPIC CONCERNING THE PREVENTION MEASURESÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ EFFECTS. BASED ON CROSS-CORRELATION ANALYSES OF FACTUAL AND MISINFORMATION TIME SERIES FOR BOTH TOPICS, WE FIND THAT THE PREVIOUSLY PREDOMINANT FACTUAL INFORMATION LEADS THE DECREASE OF MISINFORMATION (I.E., SUPPRESSION) WITH A TIME LAG. THE RESEARCH FINDINGS PROVIDE EMPIRICAL UNDERSTANDINGS OF DYNAMIC RELATIONS BETWEEN MISINFORMATION AND FACTUAL INFORMATION IN COMPLEX ONLINE ENVIRONMENTS AND SUGGEST PRACTICAL STRATEGIES FOR FUTURE MISINFORMATION MANAGEMENT DURING CRISES AND EMERGENCIES.

332,SOCIAL MEDIA AS RISKATTENUATION AND MISINFORMATIONAMPLIFICATION STATION HOW SOCIAL MEDIA INTERACTION AFFECTS MISPERCEPTIONS ABOUT COVID19,"THIS STUDY ADDRESSES HOW SOCIAL MEDIA INTERACTION AFFECTS MISPERCEPTIONS ABOUT COVID-19 VIA RISK PERCEPTIONS THEREOF AND WHETHER POLITICAL ORIENTATION MODERATES THE RELATIONSHIP. USING ORIGINAL TWO-WAVE PANEL SURVEY DATA (N =Ã‚Â 679), THIS STUDY REVEALS THAT SOCIAL MEDIA INTERACTION INCREASES MISPERCEPTION DIRECTLY, AS WELL AS INDIRECTLY BY REDUCING THE EXTENT OF RISK PERCEPTION. THE EXTENT OF RISK PERCEPTION IS FOUND TO BE A NEGATIVE PREDICTOR OF MISPERCEPTION. THE DELETERIOUS ROLE OF SOCIAL MEDIA INTERACTION ON MISPERCEPTION IS PRONOUNCED ACROSS GROUPS OF CONSERVATIVES AND LIBERALS, BUT IN DIFFERENT WAYS. ALTHOUGH THE EFFECTS OF SOCIAL MEDIA INTERACTION ON THE LEVEL OF MISPERCEPTION ARE OBSERVED IN BOTH CONSERVATIVES AND LIBERALS, THIS RELATIONSHIP IS PARTICULARLY SALIENT AMONG CONSERVATIVES. FURTHERMORE, WHEREAS CONSERVATIVES CONSISTENTLY SHOW LOW LEVELS OF RISK PERCEPTION TOWARD COVID-19 REGARDLESS OF HOW MUCH THEY INTERACT WITH OTHERS ON SOCIAL MEDIA, THE MORE LIBERALS INTERACT ON SOCIAL MEDIA, THE LESS LIKELY THEY ARE TO PERCEIVE COVID-19-RELATED RISKS. THE FINDINGS EXPAND OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE ROLE OF INTERACTION BEHAVIORS ON SOCIAL MEDIA IN FORMING RISK PERCEPTIONS AND MISPERCEPTIONS ON THE POLITICIZED COVID-19 PANDEMIC.

333,SOCIAL BOTS AND THE SPREAD OF DISINFORMATION IN SOCIAL MEDIA THE CHALLENGES OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,"ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) IS CREATING A REVOLUTION IN BUSINESS AND SOCIETY AT LARGE, AS WELL AS CHALLENGES FOR ORGANIZATIONS. AI-POWERED SOCIAL BOTS CAN SENSE, THINK AND ACT ON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS IN WAYS SIMILAR TO HUMANS. THE CHALLENGE IS THAT SOCIAL BOTS CAN PERFORM MANY HARMFUL ACTIONS, SUCH AS PROVIDING WRONG INFORMATION TO PEOPLE, ESCALATING ARGUMENTS, PERPETRATING SCAMS AND EXPLOITING THE STOCK MARKET. AS SUCH, AN UNDERSTANDING OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF SOCIAL BOTS AND THEIR AUTHORSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ INTENTIONS IS VITAL FROM THE MANAGEMENT PERSPECTIVE. DRAWING FROM THE ACTOR-NETWORK THEORY (ANT), THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES HUMAN AND NON-HUMAN ACTORSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ ROLES IN SOCIAL MEDIA, PARTICULARLY TWITTER. WE USE TEXT MINING AND MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES, AND AFTER APPLYING DIFFERENT PRE-PROCESSING TECHNIQUES, WE APPLIED THE BAG OF WORDS MODEL TO A DATASET OF 30,000 ENGLISH-LANGUAGE TWEETS. THE PRESENT RESEARCH IS AMONG THE FEW STUDIES TO USE A THEORY-BASED FOCUS TO LOOK, THROUGH EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH, AT THE ROLE OF SOCIAL BOTS AND THE SPREAD OF DISINFORMATION IN SOCIAL MEDIA.

335,FAKE NEWS THE IMPACT OF THE INTERNET ON POPULATION HEALTH,"OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE SEARCH FOR HEALTH INFORMATION ON THE INTERNET AND TO DETERMINE THE FREQUENCY AND MAIN MEANS OF SPREADING FAKE HEALTH NEWS. METHODS: A DESCRIPTIVE CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY WAS CONDUCTED THROUGH THE VIRTUAL DISTRIBUTION OF QUESTIONNAIRES ON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS IN 2019 BY USING THE SNOWBALL TECHNIQUE. THE QUESTIONNAIRE COLLECTED INFORMATION REGARDING SOCIODEMOGRAPHICS, MEANS USED TO CLARIFY DOUBTS ABOUT HEALTH, IMPLEMENTATION OF INFORMATION OBTAINED THROUGH THE INTERNET, RECEIPT OF FAKE NEWS, AND MEANS OF TRANSMISSION OF FAKE NEWS. QUANTITATIVE VARIABLES ARE DESCRIBED AS MEANS AND STANDARD DEVIATIONS, AND CATEGORICAL VARIABLES ARE DESCRIBED AS FREQUENCIES AND PERCENTAGES. THE CHI-SQUARE AND FISHER'S EXACT TESTS WERE USED. RESULTS: OUT OF 1,195 RESPONDENTS, 53% HAD FOLLOWED INTERNET GUIDANCE WITHOUT CONSULTING A HEALTH PROFESSIONAL, ESPECIALLY YOUNG PEOPLE AND INDIVIDUALS WITH LOW EDUCATION LEVELS (P<0.05). THE RESOURCES MOST USED TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT HEALTH WERE A PHYSICIAN (78%) AND GOOGLE (51%), AND SEARCHES USING THE LATTER WERE MORE PREDOMINANT AMONG YOUNGER AGE GROUPS (P<0.05). A LARGE PART OF THE SAMPLE (89.4%) HAD RECEIVED FAKE NEWS, AND THE MAIN MEANS OF RECEIPT WERE FACEBOOK AND WHATSAPP. CONCLUSIONS: THE INTERNET WAS THE SECOND MOST COMMONLY USED MEANS TO SEARCH FOR HEALTH INFORMATION. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE POPULATION ADOPTS ACTIONS BASED ON THIS INFORMATION. THE FREQUENCY OF BROADCASTING FAKE NEWS THROUGH THIS DIGITAL MEDIUM IS HIGH. Ã‚Â© 2021 ASSOCIACAO MEDICA BRASILEIRA.

338,PROPAGANDA CHIMERA UNPACKING THE IRANIAN PERCEPTION INFORMATION OPERATIONS IN THE ARAB WORLD,"IN THE PAST FOUR YEARS, IRANIAN INFORMATION OPERATIONS (IOS) HAVE RECEIVED A LOT OF SCRUTINY BY SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES AND POLICYMAKERS. FROM 2018 TO 2021, SEVERAL ACCOUNTS ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK, AND INSTAGRAM WERE TAKEN DOWN BY TECH COMPANIES FOR ENGAGING IN COORDINATED INAUTHENTIC BEHAVIOUR. DESPITE THE HEATED RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN IRAN AND MANY ARAB COUNTRIES, THE IRANIAN IOS IN THE ARABIC ONLINE SPHERE HAVE RECEIVED LESS ACADEMIC ATTENTION OVER THE YEARS. THIS STUDY FILLS THIS GAP BY BEING ONE OF THE FEW STUDIES TO INVESTIGATE THE IRANIAN IOS IN THE ARAB WORLD. WE ANALYSE MORE THAN 9.3 MILLION TWEETS POSTED FROM 2008 TO 2020 USING THE HASHED DATASETS SHARED BY TWITTER'S ELECTION INTEGRITY HUB. WE FOUND THAT IRAN'S IOS HAVE MADE THE ARAB WORLD ITS PRIMARY TARGET - DESPITE THE ATTENTION THE US CLAIMS TO RECEIVE FROM THEM. HOWEVER, THESE IOS DEMONSTRATE VERY LITTLE ENGAGEMENT AND REACH AMONGST ARAB USERS, LIMITING THE POSSIBILITIES OF IRAN INFILTRATING THE ONLINE ARABIC SPHERE, AND FOSTERING WEAK YET UNRULY ARAB COUNTERPUBLICS. THIS STUDY ARGUES THAT IRAN'S IOS GARNER THEIR POWER FROM BEING PERCEIVED AS EFFICIENT AND DANGEROUS OPERATIONS THAT COULD POLLUTE THE PUBLIC SPHERE OF OVERSEAS NATIONS, RATHER THAN THROUGH ACTUAL INFILTRATION THROUGH ENGAGEMENT. WE UNDERSTAND IRAN'S EFFORTS TO BE PREOCCUPIED WITH OLD PROPAGANDA EFFORTS, THROUGH THEIR INVESTMENT IN WEBSITES AND IMITATION OF NEWS ORGANISATIONS. HOWEVER, THEIR EFFORTS PROVE THAT IRAN ADOPTED THE TACTICS OF ""NEW PROPAGANDA""THAT DEPEND ON CREATING A PERCEIVED ATMOSPHERE OF DISTRUST AND CHAOS. WE CONTRIBUTE TO THE DISCUSSION ON INFORMATION OPERATIONS BY PROPOSING THE TERM ""PERCEPTION IOS"", REFERRING TO IOS BY GOVERNMENTS THAT ASPIRE TO BE PERCEIVED AS EFFECTIVE MEDDLING COUNTRIES IN FOREIGN POLITICS.

343,WE ARE NOT THE VIRUS COMPETING ONLINE DISCOURSES OF HUMANENVIRONMENT INTERACTION IN THE ERA OF COVID19,"PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS FOUND THAT SOCIAL MEDIA MAY BE A PARTICULARLY INFLUENTIAL MEANS OF CIRCULATING IDEOLOGIES ABOUT CLIMATE JUSTICE. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE ANALYZE SOCIAL MEDIA DISCOURSES OF UNIVERSAL HUMAN RESPONSIBILITY FOR POLLUTION AND ECOSYSTEM DESTRUCTION DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, EPITOMIZED BY THE VIRAL HASHTAG #WEARETHEVIRUS. WE THEN EXAMINE THREE TYPES OF COUNTERDISCOURSES THAT OPPOSE MISINFORMATION AND FALSE UNIVERSALIZATION OF HUMAN RESPONSIBILITY. THESE COUNTERDISCOURSES INCLUDE: (1) METADISCOURSES OF ECOFASCISM AND RACIAL INJUSTICE, (2) COUNTERSLOGANS THAT ASCRIBE RESPONSIBILITY TO SYSTEMIC INJUSTICE RATHER THAN INDIVIDUAL HUMANS (E.G. Ã¢â‚¬Å“CAPITALISM IS THE VIRUS,Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬Å“THE SYSTEM IS THE VIRUSÃ¢â‚¬Â), AND (3) MEMES THAT PARODY THE #WEARETHEVIRUS DISCOURSES (AS IN THE SARCASTIC PHRASE Ã¢â‚¬Å“NATURE IS HEALING, WE ARE THE VIRUSÃ¢â‚¬Â). WE DEMONSTRATE THAT THE FORMER TWO NONPARODIC COUNTERDISCOURSES EMERGED IN PART IN THE COMMENTS OF #WEARETHEVIRUS TWEETS, WHILE THE PARODIC MEMES EMERGED IN SEPARATE TWEETS, WHICH WERE A SITE OF SHARED HUMOR RATHER THAN CONTROVERSY. WE FURTHER DEMONSTRATE THAT, WHILE BOTH #WEARETHEVIRUS DISCOURSES AND COUNTERDISCOURSES HAVE OCCURRED RELATIVELY RARELY SINCE THEIR PERIOD OF VIRALITY AND HAVE BROADENED TO A RANGE OF DOMAINS OUTSIDE OF HUMAN-ENVIRONMENT INTERACTION, COUNTERDISCOURSES HAVE NEVERTHELESS HAD A WIDE-RANGING IMPACT, INCREASING METADISCOURSES OF ECOFASCISM AND PERMEATING MATERIAL LANDSCAPES THROUGH GRAFFITI AND SIGNAGE.

345,DISINFORMATION UNDER A NETWORKED AUTHORITARIAN STATE SAUDI TROLLS CREDIBILITY ATTACKS AGAINST JAMAL KHASHOGGI,"THIS PAPER DEALS WITH A CASE STUDY THAT PROVIDES UNIQUE AND ORIGINAL INSIGHT INTO SOCIAL MEDIA CREDIBILITY ATTACKS AGAINST THE SAUDI JOURNALIST AND ACTIVIST, JAMAL KHASHOGGI. TO GET THE DATA, I SEARCHED ALL THE STATE-RUN TWEETS SENT BY ARAB TROLLS (78,274,588 IN TOTAL), AND I USED CEDAR, CANADA'S SUPERCOMPUTER, TO EXTRACT ALL THE VIDEOS AND IMAGES ASSOCIATED WITH REFERENCES TO KHASHOGGI. IN ADDITION, I SEARCHED TWITTER'S FULL DATA ARCHIVE TO CROSS-EXAMINE SOME OF THE HASHTAG CAMPAIGNS THAT WERE LAUNCHED THE DAY KHASHOGGI DISAPPEARED AND AFTERWARDS. FINALLY, I USED CROWDTANGLE TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER SOME OF THESE HASHTAGS WERE ALSO USED ON FACEBOOK AND INSTAGRAM. I PRESENT HERE EVIDENCE THAT JUST A FEW HOURS AFTER KHASHOGGI'S DISAPPEARANCE IN THE SAUDI CONSULATE IN ISTANBUL, SAUDI TROLLS STARTED A COORDINATED DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN AGAINST HIM TO FRAME HIM AS A TERRORIST, FOREIGN AGENT FOR QATAR AND TURKEY, LIAR.... ETC. THE TROLLS ALSO EMPHASIZED THAT THE WHOLE STORY OF HIS DISAPPEARANCE AND KILLING IS A FABRICATION OR A STAGED PLAY ORCHESTRATED BY TURKEY AND QATAR. THE CAMPAIGN ALSO TARGETED HIS FIANCÃƒâ€°E, HATICE CENGIZ, ALLEGING SHE WAS A SPY, WHILE LATER THEY CAST DOUBT ABOUT HER CLAIMS. SOME OF THESE CAMPAIGNS WERE LAUNCHED A FEW MONTHS AFTER KHASHOGGI'S DEATH. THEORETICALLY, I ARGUE THAT STATE-RUN DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGNS NEED TO INCORPORATE THE DIMENSION OF INTENDED EFFECT. IN THIS CASE STUDY, THE GOAL IS TO TARNISH THE REPUTATION AND CREDIBILITY OF KHASHOGGI, EVEN AFTER HE DIED, IN AN ATTEMPT TO DISCREDIT HIS CLAIMS AND POLITICAL CAUSE, INFLUENCE DIFFERENT AUDIENCES ESPECIALLY THE SAUDI PUBLIC, AND POTENTIALLY REDUCE SYMPATHY TOWARDS HIM.

AMONG FACTORS RELATED TO SYSTEMATIC PROCESSING OF INFORMATION, WE DISCOVERED THAT THE TOPICS OF A MISINFORMATION STORY MATTER, WITH CONSPIRACY THEORIES BEING THE MOST LIKELY TO BE RETWEETED. AS FOR FACTORS RELATED TO HEURISTIC PROCESSING OF INFORMATION, SUCH AS WHEN CITIZENS LOOK UP TO THEIR LEADERS DURING SUCH A CRISIS, OUR RESULTS DEMONSTRATED THAT BEHAVIORS OF A POLITICAL LEADER, FORMER US PRESIDENT DONALD J.

348,COLLECTIVE SOCIAL CORRECTION ADDRESSING MISINFORMATION THROUGH GROUP PRACTICES OF INFORMATION VERIFICATION ON WHATSAPP,"RECENT YEARS SHOW A GROWING CONCERN ABOUT THE SPREAD OF MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA. ONE OF THE AVENUES TO ADDRESS THIS CHALLENGE IS THE PRACTICE OF SOCIAL CORRECTIONÃ¢â‚¬â€THE CORRECTION OF MISINFORMATION CONDUCTED BY OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA USERS. WHILE SOCIAL CORRECTION FOCUSES ON INDIVIDUALS IN THE CONTEXT OF THEIR RESPECTIVE SOCIAL MEDIA NETWORKS, WE OFFER THE CONCEPT OF COLLECTIVE SOCIAL CORRECTION: AN ONGOING PRACTICE OF INFORMATION VERIFICATION, OCCURRING WITHIN GROUP CONTEXTS. EMPLOYING A MIXED-METHODS APPROACH, WE EXAMINE COLLECTIVE SOCIAL CORRECTION BY ANALYSING THE CASE STUDY OF A LARGE-SCALE ISRAELI WHATSAPP GROUP, LED BY A JOURNALIST, AND DEVOTED TO INFORMAL DISCUSSION OF POLITICS AND NEWS.

AN ONLINE EXPERIMENT TESTED THE HYPOTHESES THAT HIGHER TRUST IN THE SOURCE OF FALSE INFORMATION, AND LOWER AGREEABLENESS OF THE PERSON ENCOUNTERING IT, WOULD PREDICT THEIR LIKELIHOOD OF EXTENDING ITS REACH. ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY-TWO PARTICIPANTS SAW REAL EXAMPLES OF DISINFORMATION STORIES THAT HAD BEEN POSTED TO SOCIAL MEDIA AND RATED THEIR LIKELIHOOD OF SHARING AND INTERACTING WITH IT IN OTHER WAYS. NEITHER TRUST IN THE SOURCE NOR AGREEABLENESS INFLUENCED ORGANIC REACH.

IN ORDER TO BETTER TACKLE COVID-19 IT IS IMPORTANT TO DETERMINE HOW THE GENERAL POPULATION PERCEIVE THE SHARING OF MEDICAL INFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS. BASED ON THIS, THE AIM OF THE STUDY IS TO ANALYSE THE PERCEPTION OF SAUDI ARABIAN HEALTH CARE WORKERSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (HCWS) AND NON-HEALTH CARE WORKERSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (NHCWS) REGARDING THE SHARING AND RESHARING OF MEDICAL INFORMATION, WHETHER TRUE OR FALSE, ON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS REGARDING COVID-19.

A 10-ITEM QUESTIONNAIRE WAS ADOPTED AND TRANSLATED TO ARABIC TO CONDUCT THE SURVEY. RESULTS: THE TOTAL NUMBER OF RESPONSES FOR THE STUDY WERE N=1249. THE FINDINGS OF THE STUDY INDICATE THAT SAUDI ARABIAN GENERAL POPULATION UNDERSTAND THE PREVALENCE OF UNVERIFIED INFORMATION, BUT ARE ACCEPTING OF THE PRACTICE OF SHARING INFORMATION WITHOUT EVIDENCE ON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS, WITH THE BELIEF THAT SUCH INFORMATION DOES NOT CAUSE ACTUAL HARM TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC, BUT INSTEAD WOULD BE BENEFICIAL. WHATSAPP WAS THE MOST PREFERRED SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM FOR RECEIVING AND SHARING INFORMATION AMONG PARTICIPANTS, FOLLOWED BY TWITTER AND SNAPCHAT. CONCLUSION: THE FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY INDICATE THAT THE SAUDI ARABIAN POPULATION ARE MORE WARY THAN THE GLOBAL GENERAL POPULATION REGARDING MISINFORMATION ONLINE ON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS REGARDING COVID-19.

AS NEWS PRACTITIONERS ARE INCREASINGLY CHALLENGED BY INFORMATION OVERLOAD AND THE NEED TO PROCESS HUGE VOLUMES OF UNSTRUCTURED AND UNFILTERED DATA WITHIN A VERY SHORT TIME SPAN, THE VERACITY OF ONLINE AND USER-GENERATED CONTENT (UGC) AND ITS SPREAD THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA AND VIDEO PLATFORMS HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A KEY CONCERN. THIS STUDY AIMS TO EXTEND THE BODY OF KNOWLEDGE ON THE VERIFICATION OF NEWS VIDEO CONTENT, DERIVED FROM SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS. USING A WEB-BASED TOOL THAT ANALYSES THE ONLINE CONTEXT AROUND A VIDEO POST AND PRESENTS A NUMBER OF VERIFICATION SIGNALS, A SET OF FAKE AND REAL NEWS VIDEOS COMING FROM YOUTUBE AND FACEBOOK WERE EXAMINED BY A SAMPLE OF JOURNALISM STUDENTS (N = 90) REGARDING THEIR VERACITY. A SAMPLE OF PROFESSIONAL JOURNALISTS (N = 17) WAS ALSO USED FOR QUALITATIVE COMPARISON PURPOSES AND ADDITIONAL RESULTS.

THIS STUDY FOCUSES ON THE CASE OF XIAKE_ISLAND, AN OFFICIAL WECHAT ACCOUNT AFFILIATED WITH THE PARTY NEWSPAPER, PEOPLEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S DAILY, AND TRIES TO EXPLORE HOW NEW MEDIA TECHNOLOGY REDEFINES ITS JOURNALISTIC PRACTICES. THROUGH CLOSE OBSERVATIONS AND IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS, THIS STUDY FOUND THAT PROPAGANDA STILL DOMINATES THE PRODUCTION PROCESS, BUT THE EDITORS HAVE INCORPORATED SOME ELEMENTS OF COMMERCIALISM AND PROFESSIONALISM INTO THEIR PRACTICES. THEY PAY MORE ATTENTION TO THE OBJECTIVITY AND ATTRACTIVENESS OF THE STORIES IN AN ATTEMPT TO WEAKEN THEIR MOUTHPIECE ROLE. TO SEEK THE BALANCE BETWEEN THE POLITICAL MISSION AND AUDIENCE DEMAND, THE EDITORS OF XIAKE_ISLAND HAVE DEVELOPED SOME STRATEGIES. TARGETING ELITE AUDIENCES, XIAKE_ISLAND PRODUCES ONLY HIGH-QUALITY, IN-DEPTH STORIES. WHEN COVERING NEGATIVE STORIES, IT CRITICIZES POLICY IMPLEMENTATION BY THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT WHILE AVOIDS QUESTIONING THE LEGITIMACY OF THE PARTYÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S POLICIES.

TO REVEAL THESE TRUST MECHANISMS, THIS PAPER AIMS TO IDENTIFY SALIENT PSYCHOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIOURAL FACTORS RELATED TO JOURNALISM STUDENTSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ DIFFERENT LEVELS OF TRUST. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: USING STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELLING TO ANALYSE THE SURVEY DATA OF 234 JOURNALISM STUDENTS, THIS PAPER TESTED A THEORETICAL MODEL THAT CONSIDERS SELF-EFFICACY AND THE EXPRESSIVE AND CONSUMPTIVE USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA RUMOURS AS THE ANTECEDENTS AND CONSEQUENCES OF TRUST BELIEF AND TRUST ACTION, RESPECTIVELY. FINDINGS: SELF-EFFICACY HAS A POSITIVE EFFECT ON TRUST BELIEF BUT A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON TRUST ACTION. TRUST BELIEF POSITIVELY AFFECTS EXPRESSIVE USE OF RUMOURS, WHEREAS TRUST ACTION NEGATIVELY AFFECTS CONSUMPTIVE USE.

WE THEN LOOK AT WECHAT-BASED CITIZEN JOURNALISM AS ALTERNATIVE CRISIS COMMUNICATION TO IDENTIFY ITS POPULAR THEMES AND THE CCPÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S CENSORSHIP TACTICS TO MANAGE IT. WE ARGUE THAT THE CCPÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S PROPAGANDA DURING TIMES OF CRISIS HAS BEEN MAINLY ACHIEVED THROUGH THE REVAMPING OF OFFICIAL JOURNALISM ON ITS STATE MEDIA AND THE DIFFERENTIAL CENSORSHIP OF CITIZEN DISCOURSE ON SOCIAL MEDIA. THE DOUBLE-PRONGED APPROACH ENSURES THE PUBLIC OPINION IS PROPERLY GUIDED IN CRISES AND POSSIBLE DISRUPTION TO THE REGIMEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S STABILITY IS MINIMIZED.

IN THIS STUDY, WE TEST IF POLITICAL ONLINE ASTROTURFING MESSAGES (I.E., FORGED USER COMMENTS BENEATH DIGITAL NEWS ITEMS) CAN INFLUENCE PERCEPTIONS OF PUBLIC OPINION ON THREE ISSUES: THE POISONING OF THE FORMER RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE OFFICER SERGEI SKRIPAL, THE USE OF TOXIC GAS BY RUSSIA'S CLOSE ALLY SYRIA, AND THE MANIPULATION OF THE 2016 U.S. PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. WE FURTHER EXAMINE THE IMMUNIZING EFFECTS OF THREE INOCULATION STRATEGIES TO PREVENT THE DISTORTING EFFECTS OF ONLINE ASTROTURFING COMMENTS. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT ONLY A FEW ASTROTURFING COMMENTS CAN BIAS READERS' PERCEPTIONS OF PUBLIC OPINION IN THE INTENDED DIRECTION. MOREOVER, PRIOR INOCULATION ONLY PROVIDES LIMITED PROTECTION AGAINST THIS EFFECT. ONLY ONE INOCULATION STRATEGY (REFUTATIONAL-SAME) PROVED TO BE EFFECTIVE, BUT EVEN THIS EFFECT IS ONLY SHORT-TERM.

DO THE SAME MEDIA SOURCES ALIGN WITH POSITIVE VIEWS OF MASS MOBILIZATIONS AMONG THE PUBLIC IN THEIR AFTERMATH? AND, WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MEDIA CONSUMPTION PATTERNS AND BELIEVING DISINFORMATION ABOUT PROTEST EVENTS? ADDRESSING THESE QUESTIONS HELPS US TO BETTER UNDERSTAND NOT ONLY WHAT BRINGS CROWDS ONTO THE STREETS, BUT ALSO WHAT SHAPES PERCEPTIONS OF, AND DISINFORMATION ABOUT MASS MOBILIZATION AMONG THE WIDER POPULATION. EMPLOYING ORIGINAL DATA FROM A NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE PANEL SURVEY IN UKRAINE (HALE, COLTON, ONUCH, & KRAVETS, 2014) CONDUCTED SHORTLY AFTER THE 2013Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2014 EUROMAIDAN MOBILIZATION, WE EXAMINE PATTERNS OF MEDIA CONSUMPTION AMONG BOTH PARTICIPANTS AND NON-PARTICIPANTS, AS WELL AS PROTEST SUPPORTERS AND NON-SUPPORTERS. WE ALSO EXPLORE VARIATION IN MEDIA CONSUMPTION AMONG THOSE WHO BELIEVE AND REJECT DISINFORMATION ABOUT THE EUROMAIDAN. WE TEST HYPOTHESES, PROMINENT IN CURRENT PROTEST LITERATURE, RELATED TO THE INFLUENCE OF Ã¢â‚¬Å“NEWÃ¢â‚¬Â (SOCIAL MEDIA AND ONLINE NEWS) AND Ã¢â‚¬Å“OLDÃ¢â‚¬Â MEDIA (TELEVISION) ON PROTEST BEHAVIOR AND ATTITUDES. MAKING USE OF THE SIGNIFICANCE OF 2014 UKRAINE AS A TESTING GROUND FOR RUSSIAN DISINFORMATION TACTICS, WE ALSO SPECIFICALLY TEST FOR CONSUMPTION OF RUSSIAN-OWNED TELEVISION. OUR FINDINGS INDICATE THAT FREQUENT CONSUMPTION OF Ã¢â‚¬Å“OLDÃ¢â‚¬Â MEDIA, SPECIFICALLY RUSSIAN-OWNED TELEVISION, IS SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH BOTH MOBILIZATION IN AND POSITIVE PERCEPTIONS OF PROTEST AND IS A BETTER PREDICTOR OF BELIEVING Ã¢â‚¬Å“FAKE NEWSÃ¢â‚¬Â THAN CONSUMING Ã¢â‚¬Å“NEWÃ¢â‚¬Â MEDIA SOURCES.

AIMING TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE DYNAMICS OF COVID-19 AS INFODEMIC, WE ASKED BRAZILIAN PARTICIPANTS (N=1007) TO REPORT THE PERCEIVED ACCURACY OF 20 MESSAGES (10 TRUE AND 10 FALSE). EACH MESSAGE WAS RANDOMLY PRESENTED WITHIN FIVE FICTITIOUS WHATSAPP GROUP CHATS OF VARYING POLITICAL ORIENTATION. CORRELATIONAL ANALYSES REVEALED THAT RIGHT-WING PARTICIPANTS HAD LOWER LEVELS OF TRUTH DISCERNMENT AS DID THOSE WITH GREATER TRUST IN SOCIAL MEDIA AS A RELIABLE SOURCE OF CORONAVIRUS INFORMATION. CONVERSELY, OPEN-MINDED THINKING ABOUT EVIDENCE AND TRUST IN THE WHO AND TRADITIONAL MEDIA WAS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH TRUTH DISCERNMENT. FAMILIARITY WITH THE CONTENT CONSISTENTLY INCREASED PERCEIVED TRUTHNESS FOR BOTH TRUE AND FALSE MESSAGES. RESULTS POINT TO THE NEFARIOUS EFFECTS OF COVID-19 POLITICIZATION AND UNDERLINE THE IMPORTANCE OF PROMOTING THE ABILITY TO RECOGNIZE AND VALUE NEW EVIDENCE AS WELL AS ENHANCING TRUST IN INTERNATIONAL AGENCIES AND TRADITIONAL MEDIA.

273,US EXTREMISM ON TELEGRAM FUELING DISINFORMATION CONSPIRACY THEORIES AND ACCELERATIONISM,"SEVERAL ALTERNATIVE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS HAVE EMERGED IN RESPONSE TO PERCEPTIONS THAT MAINSTREAM PLATFORMS ARE CENSORING TRADITIONAL CONSERVATIVE IDEOLOGIES. HOWEVER, MANY OF THESE ALTERNATIVE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS HAVE EVOLVED TO BE OUTLETS FOR HATE SPEECH AND VIOLENT EXTREMISM. THIS STUDY EXAMINES HATE-BASED CHANNELS ON TELEGRAM FROM A US PERSPECTIVE. WHILE TELEGRAM HAS OFTEN BEEN STUDIED IN RELATION TO ISIS, LESS IS KNOWN ABOUT ITS USAGE BY US EXTREMIST USERS AND MOVEMENTS. THE AUTHORS USED OSINT AND OBSERVATIONAL METHODS ON A SAMPLE OF 125 TELEGRAM CHANNELS CONTAINING HATE SPEECH AND VIOLENT EXTREMIST CONTENT FROM FAR-RIGHT AND FAR-LEFT PERSPECTIVES. THE AUTHORS HYPOTHESIZED THAT THERE WOULD BE A GREATER AND GROWING PRESENCE OF FAR-RIGHT ACTIVITY COMPARED TO FARLEFT ACTIVITY DUE TO CURRENT MIGRATION TRENDS AWAY FROM MAINSTREAM SOCIAL MEDIA BY THE FAR-RIGHT. THE AUTHORS ALSO SOUGHT TO OBSERVE THE PRESENCE OF DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGNS, CONSPIRACY THEORIES, AND ACCELERATIONISM ON TELEGRAM. THIS STUDY HAD FOUR MAJOR FINDINGS: (1) THE FINDINGS SUPPORTED THE HYPOTHESIS THAT MORE CHANNELS WERE HOST TO FARRIGHT DIALOGUES, YET THERE WERE SEVERAL FAR-LEFT CHANNELS PRESENT, (2) 64.8% OF THE CHANNELS GREW IN SIZE OVER A ONEWEEK PERIOD, (3) 47 OF THE 125 CHANNELS WERE CONNECTED TO WELL-KNOWN VIOLENT EXTREMIST MOVEMENTS OR HATE GROUPS, AND (4) QANON AND THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC WERE THE MOST PROMINENT SOURCES OF DISINFORMATION AND CONSPIRACY THEORIES ON TELEGRAM. THE FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY HIGHLIGHT THAT ALTERNATIVE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS ARE A GROWING ENVIRONMENT FOR A RANGE OF HATEFUL IDEOLOGIES AND ARE AIDING THE SPREAD OF DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGNS. THIS STUDY CONCLUDES WITH A DISCUSSION ON FUTURE STRATEGIES TO COMBAT THE INFLUENCE OF THE INTERNET ON RADICALIZATION OUTCOMES. Ã‚Â© 2021.

288,BEYOND FAKE NEWS ANALYTIC THINKING AND THE DETECTION OF FALSE AND HYPERPARTISAN NEWS HEADLINES,"WHY IS MISLEADING PARTISAN CONTENT BELIEVED AND SHARED? AN INFLUENTIAL ACCOUNT POSITS THAT POLITICAL PARTISANSHIP PERVASIVELY BIASES REASONING, SUCH THAT ENGAGING IN ANALYTIC THINKING EXACERBATES MOTIVATED REASONING AND, IN TURN, THE ACCEPTANCE OF HYPER- PARTISAN CONTENT. ALTERNATIVELY, IT MAY BE THAT SUSCEPTIBILITY TO HYPERPARTISAN CONTENT IS EXPLAINED BY A LACK OF REASONING. ACROSS TWO STUDIES USING DIFFERENT PARTICIPANT POOLS (TOTAL N = 1,973 AMERICANS), WE HAD PARTICIPANTS ASSESS TRUE, FALSE, AND HYPERPARTISAN NEWS HEADLINES TAKEN FROM SOCIAL MEDIA. WE FOUND NO EVIDENCE THAT ANALYTIC THINKING WAS ASSOCIATED WITH JUDGING POLITICALLY CONSISTENT HYPERPARTISAN OR FALSE HEADLINES TO BE ACCURATE AND UNBIASED. INSTEAD, ANALYTIC THINKING WAS, IN MOST CASES, ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASED TENDENCY TO DISTINGUISH TRUE HEADLINES FROM BOTH FALSE AND HYPERPAR- TISAN HEADLINES (AND WAS NEVER ASSOCIATED WITH DECREASED DISCERNMENT). THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT REASONING TYPICALLY HELPS PEOPLE DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN LOW AND HIGH QUAL- ITY POLITICAL NEWS, RATHER THAN FACILITATE BELIEF IN MISLEADING CONTENT. BECAUSE SOCIAL MEDIA PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE DISSEMINATION OF MISINFORMATION, WE ALSO INVES- TIGATED WILLINGNESS TO SHARE HEADLINES ON SOCIAL MEDIA. WE FOUND A SIMILAR PATTERN WHEREBY ANALYTIC THINKING WAS NOT GENERALLY ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED WILLINGNESS TO SHARE HYPERPARTISAN OR FALSE HEADLINES. TOGETHER, THESE RESULTS SUGGEST A POSITIVE ROLE FOR REASONING IN RESISTING MISINFORMATION. Ã‚Â© 2021, SOCIETY FOR JUDGMENT AND DECISION MAKING.

THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS ALSO HAD SEVERE POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIETAL EFFECTS AND AFFECTED MEDIA AND COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS IN UNPRECEDENTED WAYS. WHILE TRADITIONAL JOURNALISM HAS TRIED TO ADAPT TO THE RAPIDLY EVOLVING SITUATION, ALTERNATIVE NEWS MEDIA ON THE INTERNET HAVE GIVEN THE EVENTS AN IDEOLOGICAL SPIN. THESE VOICES HAVE BEEN CRITICISED FOR FURTHER-ING SOCIETAL CONFUSION AND SPREADING POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS Ã¢â‚¬ËœFAKE NEWSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ OR CONSPIRACY THEORIES VIA SOCIAL MEDIA AND OTHER ONLINE CHANNELS. THE IMPACT OF THE DISEASE AND THE LACK OF INFORMATION ASSOCIATED WITH IT HAVE ALLOWED MEDICAL MISINFORMATION TO RAPIDLY SURFACE AND PROPAGATE ON VARIOUS SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS. PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE HIGHLIGHTED A SIMILAR TREND DURING RECENT PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES, MAINLY THE EBOLA AND ZIKA OUTBREAKS. SUCH A PHENOMENON IS ALARMING ON BOTH INDIVIDUAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH LEVELS TO THE EXTENT THAT GOVERNMENTS ARE REALISING THE GRAVITY AND ATTEMPTING TO LIMIT ITS EFFECTS.

IT REPORTS THE FINDINGS OF A DISSERTATION THAT SOUGHT TO UNDERSTAND THE ROLE THAT SOCIAL MEDIA PLAYED IN THE GENERATION AND DIFFUSION OF INFORMATION DURING THE 2015 GENERAL ELECTIONS IN NIGERIA. NINE (9) RESPONDENTS WERE PURPOSIVELY SAMPLED FOR THE RESEARCH AND A CONTENT ANALYSIS OF THEIR SOCIAL MEDIA PAGES WAS CONDUCTED. INDUCTIVE APPROACH WAS EMPLOYED IN ANALYZING THE DATA REALIZED FROM THE CONTENT ANALYZED PAGES FROM THE RESPONDENTS. THE FINDINGS OF THE STUDY SHOWED THAT THERE WAS A HIGHER USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA DURING THE 2015 GENERAL ELECTIONS AS COMPARED TO PREVIOUS ELECTIONS AND WAS USED TO POST OFFENSIVE INFORMATION ABOUT THE CANDIDATES. ALSO, THE STUDY REVEALED THAT MOST PEOPLE SHARED OR WERE MOST LIKELY TO SHARE WHAT THEY BELIEVED TO BE TRUE WHICH HAD PROPAGANDA AND HIGH MISINFORMATION. PEOPLE AND FRIENDS ON SOCIAL MEDIA MADE SENSE OF INFORMATION RECEIVED AT FACE VALUE AND IN MOST CASES WERE NOT AS INTERESTED IN THE MESSAGE POSTED BUT WHERE THE PERSON MAKING THE POST WAS FROM. SOCIAL MEDIA WAS EXTENSIVELY USED TO PROPAGATE HATE AND DIVISIVE SENTIMENTS DURING THE 2015 ELECTIONEERING PERIOD IN NIGERIA. THE STUDY CONCLUDED THAT AS SOCIAL MEDIA CONTINUES TO GAIN IMMENSE TRACTION IN TERMS OF USE IN SOCIETY, STEPS NEED TO BE TAKEN TO REDUCE THE UNENDING POSSIBILITIES FOR MISINFORMATION, PROPAGANDA, AND RUMOURS WHICH IF MISCONSTRUED COULD LEAD TO CONFLICT SITUATIONS Ã‚Â© 2021, LIBRARY PHILOSOPHY AND PRACTICE.

365,PUBLIC PERCEPTIONS OF THE PERILS OF MISINFORMATION IN PANDEMIC,"OBJECTIVE: TO INVESTIGATE THE PUBLIC PERCEPTION REGARDING TO THE PERILS OF MISINFORMATION IN PANDEMIC. METHODOLOGY: THIS QUANTITATIVE CROSS-SECTIONAL DESIGN STUDY WITH CONVENIENT SAMPLING TECHNIQUES WAS CONDUCTED IN THE IAHS, UAJ&K IN MARCH TO APRIL 2020 AFTER ETHICAL APPROVAL. SAMPLE WITH BOTH GENDERS, USING ANY TYPES OF SOCIAL MEDIA BETWEEN 15 TO 65 YEARS OF AGES WAS SELECTED. THOSE WHO USED SOCIAL MEDIA FOR 2 YEARS WERE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY, WHILE NEW SOCIAL MEDIA USERS WERE EXCLUDED. THE DATE WERE COLLECTED FROM ONLINE SURVEY WITH STRUCTURAL QUESTIONNAIRE AND WAS ANALYZED ON SPSS VERSION 21. RESULTS: OUT OF 229 PARTICIPANTS, 107(46%) SAID THAT PANDEMIC WAS DUE TO PUNISHMENT FROM GOD. SOME THOUGHT IT RESULTED FROM SOME SORT OF HUMAN NEGLIGENCE (N=40, 17%), AND A FEW OF THEM SAID IT'S A MAN-MADE BIOLOGICAL WEAPON (N=15, 6%). THE PARTICIPANTS HAD PHYSICAL (N=17, 7%), SOCIAL (N=66, 28%), ECONOMICAL (N=67, 29%), AND MENTAL (N=35, 15%) ISSUES DUE TO PANDEMIC. TO AVOID THE MISINFORMATION MAJORITY RESPONDENT DECIDED TO STOP POSTING/SHARING (N=99, 53%) PROVIDE OR SHARE AUTHENTIC INFORMATION (N=97, 42%), MOTIVATE OTHER (N=94, 41%) AND DELETE/REPORT MISINFORMATION (N=65, 25%).

RESEARCH METHODOLOGY: IN THIS QUANTITATIVE STUDY AN ONLINE SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED AMONG LAWYERS IN PAKISTAN. THE POPULATION OF THE STUDY WAS MADE UP OF PRACTICING LAWYERS FROM DIFFERENT DISTRICT BAR ASSOCIATIONS IN PAKISTAN. A QUESTIONNAIRE WAS DISTRIBUTED TO COLLECT DATA REGARDING DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION, USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA, RESPONSE TO MISINFORMATION ABOUT COVID-19 ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND TO IDENTIFY THE METHODS EMPLOYED BY LAWYERS TO CHECK THE AUTHENTICITY OF SUCH INFORMATION. COLLECTED DATA WERE FIRST ANALYZED BY USING STATISTICAL PACKAGE FOR SOCIAL SCIENCE (SPSS V 23) AND THEN PRESENTED IN FREQUENCY, MEAN, PERCENTAGE, AND STANDARD DEVIATION. FINDINGS: THE STUDY REVEALED THAT THE MAJORITY OF LAWYERS USE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS. IT SHOWS THAT THE MOST POPULAR SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS AMONG THE LAWYERS ARE FACEBOOK AND WHATSAPP. THE OUTCOME SHOWS THAT LAWYERS ENCOUNTER FAKE STORIES ABOUT COVID-19. CRITICAL THINKING, COMPARISON, AND CROSS-CHECKING ARE AMONG THE MOST COMMONLY USED TECHNIQUES EMPLOYED BY THE LAWYERS TO CHECK THE AUTHENTICITY OF ANY INFORMATION ABOUT THE COVID-19 ON SOCIAL MEDIA. IT ALSO REVEALED THAT MOST OF THE TIME THEY SHARE SUCH NEWS AFTER CHECKING ITS AUTHENTICITY BUT SOMETIMES THEY SHARE IT WITHOUT CONFIRMING IT. Ã‚Â© 2021.

PUBLIC COMMENTS WERE COLLECTED FROM THE RELEVANT FACEBOOK POSTS RELATED TO AN ONLINE RELIGIOUS DISINFORMATION THAT TOOK PLACE IN APRIL 2019 AND ANALYZED FOLLOWING A QUALITATIVE CONTENT ANALYSIS METHOD. THE THREE KEY FINDINGS OF THIS RESEARCH ARE: (A) SOCIAL MEDIA USERS REACT TO DISINFORMATION MORE EMOTIONALLY THAN REASONABLY; (B) MORE USERS SHOW DIVERSE FORMS OF DESTRUCTIVE REACTIONS WHEN THEY ENCOUNTER DISINFORMATION; AND (C) ALTHOUGH MORE USERS HAVE STRONG REASONING SKILLS, ONLY A FEW USERS SHOW CONSTRUCTIVE REACTIONS AFTER ENCOUNTERING DISINFORMATION. THESE RESULTS INDICATE THE PRESENCE OF HATE SPIN THAT TEND TO MARGINALIZE RELIGIOUS MINORITIES IN BOTH SOCIAL MEDIA AND SOCIETY. THIS STUDY HAS LIMITATIONS RELATED TO THE DATA ANALYSIS AND GENERALIZATION PROBLEM OF THE FINDINGS.

THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO UNDERSTAND THE EARLY DEVELOPMENT OF KEY COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES OF HIS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN SINCE 2016. WE USED A COMBINATION OF OBSERVATIONAL, DISCOURSE, AND CONTENT ANALYSIS BASED ON DIGITAL TRACE DATA TO INVESTIGATE HOW BOLSONARO HAD BEEN TESTING HIS CAMPAIGN TARGETS AND SEGMENTATION, AS WELL AS CULTIVATING BOT ACCOUNTS AND BOTNETS ON TWITTER DURING THE 2016 RIO DE JANEIRO MUNICIPAL ELECTION. OUR RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT THE AUTOMATION OF DIFFERENT SUPPORTER PROFILES TO TARGET POTENTIAL VOTER IDENTITIES AND THE EXPERIMENTAL DISSEMINATION OF DIVISIVE NARRATIVES ENSURED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF HIS COMMUNICATION PERSUASION.

THE GOAL OF OUR PAPER IS TO INVESTIGATE FAKE NEWS, AIMING AT BOTH CLARIFYING THE CONCEPT AND DISCUSSING THE POSSIBLE INTEGRATION OF IDEOLOGICALLY DRIVEN INFORMATION UNDER THIS LARGE UMBRELLA, AS WELL AS INVESTIGATING CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH VARIOUS TYPES OF FAKE NEWS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO GO VIRAL. IN THIS STUDY WE CONSIDER IDEOLOGICALLY DRIVEN NEWS AS A FORM OF DISINFORMATION, BY THE MERE REASON THAT THERE IS A CLEAR INTENTION TO DECEIVE BEHIND THIS TYPE OF NEWS. AT THE SAME TIME, WE ARGUE THAT, COMPARED TO NO MORE THAN ONE-TWO DECADES AGO, IDEOLOGICALLY DRIVEN INFORMATION IS POTENTIALLY MUCH MORE HARMFUL, BY VIRTUE OF THE POTENTIAL OF BEING SHARED, EASILY FURTHER DISSEMINATED WITHIN ECHO-CHAMBERS AND WITH THE HELP OF FILTER BUBBLES. IN LINE WITH RECENT STUDIES, WE CONTEND THAT, AT ITS CORE, THE FAKE NEWS PROBLEM CONCERNS THE ECONOMICS OF EMOTION, SPECIFICALLY HOW EMOTIONS ARE USED AND OFTEN ABUSED TO FOSTER AUDIENCE'S ATTENTION, ENGAGEMENT, AND WILLINGNESS TO SHARE CONTENT. IN THIS CONTEXT, AND UNDER THE RECENT POLITICAL CIRCUMSTANCES IN ROMANIA (MARKED BY ANTI-GOVERNMENT PROTESTS AND PUBLIC OPPOSITION TO THE RULING POLITICAL PARTY), OUR AIM IS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW PEOPLE'S SUSCEPTIBILITY TO DISSEMINATE DECEITFUL INFORMATION IS ENHANCED BY VARIOUS FORMS AND VALENCES OF POLITICALLY BIASED FAKE NEWS, AND WHAT IS THE ROLE OF SPECIFIC EMOTIONS IN EXPLAINING THIS PROCESS. BULDING ON TANDOC ET AL.'S CLASSIFICATION OF FAKE NEWS, WE PROPOSE A 2X2X2 EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN, IN WHICH WE MANIPULATED INTENTION TO DECEIVE, LEVEL OF FACTICITY AND VALENCE. THE SURVEY EXPERIMENT (N=813) TESTS TWO POSITIVE (ENTHUSIASM AND CONTENTMENT) AND TWO NEGATIVE (ANGER AND FEAR) DISCRETE EMOTIONS AS MEDIATORS OF THE MAIN EFFECT OF POTENTIAL OF VIRALISATION EFFECTS (I.E. HOW LIKELY USERS ARE TO SHARE FAKE NEWS ON A SOCIAL NETWORK). RESULTS SHOW THAT NEGATIVELY BIASED FAKE NEWS ENHANCES PEOPLE'S WILLINGNESS TO SHARE THE NEWS STORY, WHILE POSITIVELY BIASED FAKE NEWS HAS NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE VIRALISATION POTENTIAL.

WE RESORTED TO A MIXED-METHOD APPROACH BASED ON GROUNDED THEORY AND OBSERVATIONAL TECHNIQUES IN ORDER TO INVESTIGATE THE BOTS' ACTIVITIES ONLINE DURING THE 2016 MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS IN RIO DE JANEIRO. WE COLLECTED RELATED CONTENT ON TWITTER IN THIS PERIOD AND DETECTED 3,101 BOTS. THIS SAMPLE WAS CLASSIFIED IN THREE CATEGORIES BASED ON TWEETING CONTENT: USER-GENERATED BOT, MEDIA SPAMBOT, AND POLITICAL BOT. OUR FINDINGS INDICATE THAT, ALTHOUGH BOTS WORK FOR DIFFERENT POLITICAL AND SOCIAL PURPOSES, THEIR COMPUTATIONAL NATURE CLAIMS INTO SERVICE OF DOMINANT SOCIAL GROUPS AND ECONOMICAL ELITES.

THE ALGORITHMIC FILTER BUBBLES AND ECHO CHAMBERS THAT HAVE POPULARIZED THESE PLATFORMS MAY ALSO INCREASE EXPOSURE TO FAKE NEWS. BECAUSE OF THIS, SCHOLARS HAVE SUGGESTED DISRUPTING THE STREAM OF CONGRUENT INFORMATION THAT FILTER BUBBLES AND ECHO CHAMBERS PRODUCE, AS THIS MAY REDUCE THE IMPACT AND CIRCULATION OF MISINFORMATION. TO TEST THIS, A SURVEY EXPERIMENT WAS CONDUCTED VIA AMAZON MTURK. PARTICIPANTS READ 10 SHORT STORIES THAT WERE EITHER ALL FAKE OR HALF REAL AND HALF FAKE. THESE TREATMENT CONDITIONS WERE MADE UP OF STORIES AGREEABLE TO THE PERSPECTIVE OF DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS, OR A MIX OF BOTH. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT PARTICIPANTS ASSIGNED TO CONDITIONS THAT WERE AGREEABLE TO THEIR POLITICAL WORLD VIEW FOUND FAKE STORIES MORE BELIEVABLE COMPARED TO PARTICIPANTS WHO RECEIVED A HETEROGENEOUS MIX OF NEWS STORIES COMPLEMENTARY TO BOTH WORLD VIEWS. HOWEVER, THIS ""BREAK UP"" EFFECT APPEARS CONFINED TO DEMOCRATIC PARTICIPANTS; FINDINGS INDICATE THAT REPUBLICANS ASSIGNED TO FILTER BUBBLE TREATMENT CONDITIONS BELIEVED FAKE NEWS STORIES AT APPROXIMATELY THE SAME RATE AS THEIR FELLOW PARTISANS RECEIVING A HETEROGENEOUS MIX OF NEWS ITEMS.

586,COMPREHENSIVE DECOMPOSITION OPTIMIZATION METHOD FOR LOCATING KEY SETS OF COMMENTERS SPREADING CONSPIRACY THEORY IN COMPLEX SOCIAL NETWORKS,"WITH THE POWER OF SOCIAL MEDIA BEING HARNESSED TO COORDINATE EVENTS AND REVOLUTIONS ACROSS THE GLOBE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO IDENTIFY THE KEY SETS OF INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE THE POWER TO MOBILIZE CROWDS. THESE KEY SETS HAVE HIGHER RESOURCES AT THEIR DISPOSAL AND CAN REGULATE THE FLOW OF INFORMATION IN SOCIAL NETWORKS. THEY CAN MAXIMIZE INFORMATION SPREAD AND INFLUENCE/MANIPULATE CROWDS WHEN THEY ARE COORDINATING. BUT DUE TO THE INHERENT DRAWBACKS IN NODE-BASED AND NETWORK-BASED COMMUNITY DETECTION ALGORITHMS, NEITHER OF THESE TYPES OF ALGORITHMS CAN BE USED TO DETECT/IDENTIFY THESE KEY SETS. IN THIS STUDY, WE PRESENT A BI-LEVEL MAX-MAX OPTIMIZATION APPROACH TO IDENTIFY THESE KEY SETS, WHERE THE DEGREE CENTRALITY IS USED TO IDENTIFY INDIVIDUALS' INFLUENCE AT THE COMMENTER-LEVEL, WHILE THE NETWORK-LEVEL IS DESIGNED TO EVALUATE THE SPECTRAL MODULARITY VALUES. WE ALSO PRESENT A SET OF EVALUATION METRICS THAT CAN BE USED TO RANK THESE KEY SETS FOR AN IN-DEPTH INVESTIGATION. WE DEMONSTRATED THE EFFICACY OF THE PROPOSED MODEL BY IDENTIFYING KEY SETS HIDDEN IN A YOUTUBE NETWORK SPREADING FAKE NEWS ABOUT THE CONFLICT IN SOUTH CHINA SEA. THE NETWORK CONSISTED OF 47,265 COMMENTS, 8477 COMMENTERS, AND 5095 VIDEOS. A CO-COMMENTER NETWORK WAS CONSTRUCTED, WHERE TWO COMMENTERS WERE LINKED TOGETHER IF THEY COMMENT ON SAME VIDEO. THE PROPOSED MODEL EFFICIENTLY IDENTIFIED KEY SETS OF COMMENTERS SPREAD INFORMATION TO THE WHOLE NETWORK TO MANIPULATE YOUTUBE'S RECOMMENDATION AND SEARCH ALGORITHM TO INCREASE THE INFORMATION DISSEMINATION. MOREOVER, THE PROJECTED APPROACH COULD IDENTIFY SETS OF COMMENTERS THAT WERE KEY CONNECTORS TO MULTIPLE GROUPS, HIGH INFLUENCE ACROSS THE NETWORK, HIGHER INTERACTIONS, AND REACHABILITY THAN OTHER REGULAR COMMUNITIES. BESIDES, THE GIRVAN-NEWMAN MODULARITY METHOD, THE DEPTH-FIRST SEARCH METHOD, AND TEXT ANALYSIS WAS APPLIED TO VALIDATE THE OUTCOMES, CATEGORIZE THE IDENTIFIED KEY SETS, AND MONITOR THE COMMENTERS' BEHAVIORS AND INFORMATION SPREAD STRATEGIES IN THE NETWORK.

693,COMBATING FAKE NEWS ON SOCIAL MEDIA WITH SOURCE RATINGS THE EFFECTS OF USER AND EXPERT REPUTATION RATINGS,"AS A REMEDY AGAINST FAKE NEWS ON SOCIAL MEDIA, WE EXAMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THREE DIFFERENT MECHANISMS FOR SOURCE RATINGS THAT CAN BE APPLIED TO ARTICLES WHEN THEY ARE INITIALLY PUBLISHED: EXPERT RATING (WHERE EXPERT REVIEWERS FACT-CHECK ARTICLES, WHICH ARE AGGREGATED TO PROVIDE A SOURCE RATING), USER ARTICLE RATING (WHERE USERS RATE ARTICLES, WHICH ARE AGGREGATED TO PROVIDE A SOURCE RATING), AND USER SOURCE RATING (WHERE USERS RATE THE SOURCES THEMSELVES). WE CONDUCTED TWO EXPERIMENTS AND FOUND THAT SOURCE RATINGS INFLUENCED SOCIAL MEDIA USERSâ€™ BELIEFS IN THE ARTICLES AND THAT THE RATING MECHANISMS BEHIND THE RATINGS MATTERED. LOW RATINGS, WHICH WOULD MARK THE USUAL CULPRITS IN SPREADING FAKE NEWS, HAD STRONGER EFFECTS THAN DID HIGH RATINGS. WHEN THE RATINGS WERE LOW, USERS PAID MORE ATTENTION TO THE RATING MECHANISM, AND, OVERALL, EXPERT RATINGS AND USER ARTICLE RATINGS HAD STRONGER EFFECTS THAN DID USER SOURCE RATINGS. WE ALSO NOTICED A SECOND-ORDER EFFECT, WHERE RATINGS ON SOME SOURCES LED USERS TO BE MORE SKEPTICAL OF SOURCES WITHOUT RATINGS, EVEN WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO THE CONTRARY. A USERâ€™S BELIEF IN AN ARTICLE, IN TURN, INFLUENCED THE EXTENT TO WHICH USERS WOULD ENGAGE WITH THE ARTICLE (E.G., READ, LIKE, COMMENT AND SHARE).
